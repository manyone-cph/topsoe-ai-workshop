# Content Analysis Rules

# General Content Rules
When analysing the content of the files, only analyse their content and not the technical formatting and details of the file.
Focus on the actual text, messaging, and narrative flow rather than HTML/markdown syntax.
When analysing an entire file, split the feedback into sections and return changes for each section individually rather than the entire file change at once.
