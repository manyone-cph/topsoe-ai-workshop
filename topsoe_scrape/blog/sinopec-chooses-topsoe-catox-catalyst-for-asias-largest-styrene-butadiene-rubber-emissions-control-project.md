# Sinopec chooses Topsoe CATOX catalyst for Asia’s largest styrene-butadiene rubber emissions control project

*Published: July 12, 2018*

- Sinopec Qilu Petrochemical Corporation has chosen Topsoe’s CATOX catalyst for cost-efficient control of volatile organic compounds (VOC) at their rubber plant in Zibo, China.
- The facility has two lines with a total capacity of 240,000 Nm3/h, which makes it the largest current styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) emissions control project in Asia.
- Sinopec Qilu focused on guaranteed emission compliance, short delivery time, and low investment costs.

Haldor Topsoe has delivered the catalyst charge for a new regenerative catalytic oxidizer at the Sinopec Qilu styrene-butadiene rubber plant in Zibo – the biggest rubber producer in China and part of Sinopec Group, the world’s largest oil refining, gas & petrochemical conglomerate.

“The catalyst performance has been excellent since start up. We have been very happy with the fast catalyst delivery from Topsoe,” says Mr. Li, Vice Plant Director of Sinopec Qilu Rubber.

The CATOX catalyst is a platinum monolith that oxidizes hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOC) into harmless CO2and H2O at very low temperatures, saving energy and investment costs. The CATOX catalyst is suited for a number of industries in addition to SBR, including purified terephthalic acid (PTA), formaldehyde, ethylene oxide, and CO2purification.

Topsoe provides cutting-edge complete VOC removal solutions or individual deliveries according to customer requirements. The solutions do not generate secondary pollution and can reduce or even eliminate the use of auxiliary fuels. Topsoe has done research and development of VOC removal processes and catalysts since the late 1970s.
