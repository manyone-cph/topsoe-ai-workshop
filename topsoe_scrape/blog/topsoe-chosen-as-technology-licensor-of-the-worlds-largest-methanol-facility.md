# Topsoe chosen as technology licensor of the world’s largest methanol facility

*Published: January 30, 2018*

- IGP Methanol LLC has awarded Haldor Topsoe a contract for engineering of a methanol plant that will produce 1.8 million tons per year, which is part of a planned complex with a total production capacity of 7.2 million tons per year.
- Topsoe’s SynCOR Methanol™ technology will be at the core of the project.
- IGP plans to construct four identical SynCOR Methanol™ plants as part of their Gulf Coast Methanol facility in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, in the U.S.

"It has been essential for IGP to select best-in-class technology. We have chosen Topsoe’s SynCOR Methanol™ technology because it offers high single-line capacity with the lowest emission per ton of methanol produced and unrivaled economies of scale. Topsoe’s SynCOR™ reforming technology has proven reliable and safe industrial operation, and their methanol conversion technology is used worldwide. It combines all the qualities we look for in an integrated solution," says James Lamoureaux, Managing Director, IGP Methanol.IGP’s Gulf Coast Methanol complex is planned to be the world’s largest methanol production facility and one of the most efficient and environmentally responsible.

A SynCOR™ solution integrates state-of-the-art catalysts, proprietary technology and equipment as part of the technology license. It is suitable for large-scale grassroots ammonia, methanol, HyCO and gas-to-liquid (GTL) plants, as well as TIGAS™ gasoline plants and syngas hubs producing multiple products.

IGP Methanol LLC was recently granted a title V Air Quality Permit by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, and the company has also secured natural gas supply, gas transportation, oxygen and nitrogen supply, as well as storage and loading partners for the Gulf Coast Methanol facility. Production is planned to begin in late 2020.
