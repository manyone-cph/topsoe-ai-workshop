# How to stay on top of hydroprocessing and why training is the way to go

*Published: August 1, 2019*

Knowledge and knowledge sharing have been a part of Topsoe’s core identity since day one. We’ve been researching hydrotreating down to the atomic level since the early seventies, and in the mid-nineties, we expanded the hydroprocessing portfolio to also include hydrocracking. As our expertise grew, we’ve been creating more and more opportunities to share it with the customers.

*Our experts come from various backgrounds to provide customers with training on variety of topics.*

## **Unique knowledge exchange opportunity**

Over the years, we’ve developed a range of courses and events for our customers to share valuable insights and expand our knowledge together. They provide a great knowledge exchange platform, often for very specialized and small communities of experts.

For example, last year's pilot plant workshop in Rio de Janeiro gathered a group of R&D specialists to discuss the best practices and challenges that they encounter on a daily basis. “The pilot plant community is a small one and there’s basically no other forum for these experts to meet and share their experiences,” says Sylvain Verdier, Senior Business Strategy Manager.

## **From hydrocracking to hydrotreating**

Customers’ needs and pains are the main factor when it comes to designing our courses and events. The team organizing the events is composed of experts with various backgrounds, which enables us to offer a wide variety of topics at all levels of complexity.

For instance, the upcoming[hydroprocessing course](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/topsoe-academytm-hydroprocessing-course-optimize-your-hydroprocessing-units-2019-tickets-54344711495)for Topsoe customers, which we’ve been organizing yearly for the past 15 years, offers fundamental knowledge within hydroprocessing to refinery engineers in the beginning of their career. The course is revised regularly to touch upon relevant up-to-date topics, for example dewaxing and renewables.

*The courses help customers to stay on top of the newest developments in refining.*

On the other end of the spectrum we have more advanced seminars about hydrotreating and hydrocracking that take place every couple of years. Seminar attendees get to explore the latest hydroprocessing developments in the context of challenges and opportunities they have to face, for instance the changes in bunker fuel regulations. Together we discuss the future of the refining industry and the current trends.

In May, for example, we organized a seminar dedicated to[hydroprocessing of renewable feedstocks](https://www.topsoe.com/processes/renewables), a topic that has recently become very popular due to new legislation and changing market demands. With over 120 participants present, we presented our detailed insights into how to address the challenges as well as how to benefit from the opportunities in this field.

## **All over the world**

We want to reach our customers wherever they are which is why our events take place all over the world. Recently, we trained operators and process engineers working with hydroprocessing in Columbia and Thailand, we also have an upcoming workshop in Turkey.

We are confident that knowledge, science, and technology are the right tools not only to solve crucial challenges but also to grow together with our customers.
