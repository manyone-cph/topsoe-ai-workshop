# Video: Montana Renewables converts extra refinery capacity to SAF production

*Published: April 23, 2024*

Bruce Fleming, CEO of Montana Renewables, explains how the Great Falls-based refinery became the largest sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producer in the Western Hemisphere. This was achieved by recognizing the possibility in turning idle hydrotreater capacity into a renewable fuels opportunity.Bruce and his team sourced renewable feedstock for the project, rearranged the refinery accordingly, and were producing SAF in just 18 months. And now? Montana Renewables, with Topsoe as its technology partner, is ready to ramp up their SAF production 10-fold within a two-year horizon.
