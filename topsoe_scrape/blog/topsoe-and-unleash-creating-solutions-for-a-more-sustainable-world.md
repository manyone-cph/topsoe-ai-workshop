# Topsoe and UNLEASH – creating solutions for a more sustainable world

*Published: December 20, 2019*

*Get the video report from an international think-tank of 1000 global top talents. Three Haldor Topsoe employees joined them to develop solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges.*

Three Topsoe talents joined UNLEASH Innovation Lab in China from November 6-13, 2019, to develop new solutions within eight UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) themes. Along with 1000 other global top talents, they spent an intense week to develop solutions to match the huge challenges addressed in the SDGs.

“UNLEASH is a perfect match for Topsoe. It is in our DNA to work together with societies and customers and use the company’s unique competences to solve global challenges. UNLEASH gives some of our talented young employees the opportunity to meet other global talents and work on pressing challenges as described in the sustainable development goals,” says Kristine Ahrensbach, GVP, Global Marketing & Communications.

**Topsoe changemakers**

Handpicked from a large group of talented applicants, Regina Bulatova, Rajarshi Bandyopadhyay, and Zeina Maroun represented Topsoe at UNLEASH Innovation Lab to discuss global concerns and work on solutions to accelerate innovation. All three experienced the work as a step forward to address growing global needs and help all the great solutions become a reality.

“This initiative can contribute to a change in mindset, so that we not only think that we must make our solutions sustainable, but that sustainability is the solution,” said Zeina.

**Contributing to change**

Through an innovation process, UNLEASH supported the participants in transforming their ideas into sustainable solutions. Regina worked on Responsible Consumption & Production (SDG 12), Rajarshi addressed Affordable & Clean Energy (SDG 7), and Zeina’s area was Quality Education (SDG 4).

In their interview, they talk about their themes, addressing the problems, and how they worked together with other talents to find solutions. You will also get to know more about the innovation process, and how they intend to apply their learnings at Haldor Topsoe.

**What is UNLEASH?**

UNLEASH is a global initiative aiming to create the world’s largest innovation lab for the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Every year, UNLEASH gathers 1000 of the world’s brightest young talents to problem-solve, innovate, and collaborate in teams to develop new solutions to global challenges and help reach the SDGs by 2030.
