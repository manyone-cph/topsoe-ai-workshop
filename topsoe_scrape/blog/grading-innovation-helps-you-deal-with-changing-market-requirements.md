# Grading innovation helps you deal with changing market requirements

*Published: September 13, 2019*

## **Keeping on keeping you ahead**

Topsoe grading innovation keeps ahead of the market so that you can keep ahead in*your*operations, and deal with your specific challenges. The playing field is changing all the time.

It’s an ongoing process of continuous groundbreaking research and engineering innovation, not least because market requirements and expectations are in constant flux – worldwide.

## more**Circumstances continuously changing**

The feedstocks that refineries need to process are increasingly unpredictable, with fluctuating specifications (including a growing percentage of renewables) and a broad spectrum of impurities and contaminants that can be difficult to deal with. At the same time, legislation requirements and emissions restrictions place new demands on many aspects of hydroprocessing operations.

We strive to make sure you and your colleagues are in a good position to tackle all this effectively, and keep ahead of the curve wherever possible.

## **Research, monitoring and analysis**

Nothing beats analysis, experience and expertise when tackling complicated operating challenges. Topsoe has built up an unparalleled 40 years’ of industrial experience about grading chemistry as well as vast experience with tackling complex reactor fouling challenges.

It’s difficult to realistically simulate the processing cycle in the lab or in pilot units when it comes to grading.

Therefore, we continuously sample the grading materials when the catalyst is being unloaded from industrial units, to secure valuable data about how specific contaminants lodge in and migrate through the different grading layers, as well as conduct comprehensive analysis of spent grading products.

Our new grading products are always tested industrially prior to launch. This is usually done by installing test canisters in particular locations within a specific hydroprocessing reactor. Such canisters are loaded with multiple grading catalysts in different compartments, to measure how each reacts to a known set of contaminants in the course of the entire cycle. We remove the canister for comprehensive analysis once the cycle is complete.

*Test canister.*

We install more than 100 such test canisters in different refinery setups every year, enabling our experts to compare grading performance across a vast range of different feedstocks and conditions.

As a result, the grading solution we provide for you draws on a vast body of data accumulated from hydroprocessing operations all over the world. You get the best of the best, continually updated and refined to benefit from the latest scientific research and world-leader chemical engineering capabilities.

## **Every two years(-ish)**

As market leader in advanced grading products and services for refineries’– and in the groundbreaking atomic-level research that makes this possible – Topsoe is able to release a steady stream of new products.

Our increasing focus on providing Topsoe refinery customers with exceptional reactor grading capabilities means we’re launching new products at fairly regular intervals – currently approx. every two years.

The most recent are:

- The TopTrap™ series
- The SiliconTrap™ series
- The 300 series for renewables
