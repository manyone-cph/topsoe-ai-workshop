*Published: March 19, 2024*

With greater attention falling on the use of aviation for travel and the movement of goods, the shipping sector has escaped a lot of scrutiny. This is changing fast, however, as more decarbonization focus is being placed on supply chains and the so-called Scope 3 emissions.

With many alternative propulsion options available to sea-faring vessels, a major hurdle is deciding which technologies are viable.

David Weston, Editor-in-Chief of[FORESIGHT Climate & Energy](https://podcasts.apple.com/dk/podcast/introducing-energy-enablers/id1667260514?i=1000596080808)[](https://podcasts.apple.com/dk/podcast/introducing-energy-enablers/id1667260514?i=1000596080808)met up with Topsoe’s Chief Commercial Officer, Elena Scaltritti, to learn more about Topsoe’s work in this area and why ammonia could be a contender in the shipping sector.
