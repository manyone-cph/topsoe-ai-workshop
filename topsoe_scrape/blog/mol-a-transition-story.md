# Video: MOL GROUP - A Refinery Story

*Published: September 26, 2024*

Transitioning from fossil fuels to carbon neutralityHow can you successfully transition your traditional fossil-fuel-based operations into a low-carbon, sustainable business model? Many refineries have been looking for the answer to that specific question in recent years, as they strive to align their businesses with the global journey towards a net-zero future.

In 2016, MOL Group, an international oil and gas company, started looking for the answer to this very question. Driven by an ambition to achieve net zero emissions in 2050, MOL Group started to implement changes across the entire company with a purpose of adopting a more circular approach across all areas of their fuels and chemicals business.

MOL Group's journey to a sustainable future

We’ve talked to Zoltan Eller, Development Expert, at MOL Group, for the details on MOL’s transition into a sustainable business model. Watch this video to hear what Zoltan had to say.

The interview is conducted by Mikala Grubb, Senior Director, Commercial Excellence and Marketing, Topsoe. The recording took place during our Topsoe seminar 'Refineries of Tomorrow' in Copenhagen earlier this year.

MOL's key steps towards transformation

The quest towards carbon neutrality in 2050 across all scopes (scopes 1, 2 and 3) requires a series of essential steps. One of MOL Group's initial steps involved the implementation of various measures to reduce carbon footprint of their production processes. They did this by utilizing solar energy as the primary electrical source in their units and utilities. Additionally, in April 2024, they added a hydrogen grid, and inaugurated their first[green hydrogen](/processes/green-hydrogen)plant in their Danube refinery. This facility has a production capacity of 10 MW, making it a significant milestone in their journey towards carbon neutrality.

MOL Group has also outlined a plan to implement additional energy efficiency improvements of the units and equipment later in 2024. This includes enhancing the energy efficiency of their fired heaters through the utilization of heater pipe coatings in order to optimize heat transfer and minimize energy losses. Furthermore, they plan to improve the pre-air heaters in the fired heaters at their refinery which will also enhance the overall energy efficiency of their operations[renewable fuels](/processes/renewables)and recycled polymers and[plastic](/circular-plastic). They also have a biofuel center in which they[co-processes](/co-processing-for-kerosene-hydrotreating?hsCtaTracking=95ed5772-97a1-4cd8-8664-e8f48c7f03eb%7Cc95fd00b-b4d1-40b3-a03a-ec674cc06b75)bio-originated fuels.
