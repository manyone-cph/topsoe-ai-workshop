# Perdaman chooses SynCOR™ solution for world’s largest ammonia plant

*Published: August 21, 2019*

- With a planned capacity of 3,500 metric tons per day, the Perdaman plant will be the world’s largest single-line ammonia plant.
- It will also be the first to apply Haldor Topsoe’s cutting-edge technology for large-scale ammonia production, SynCOR Ammonia™, that significantly reduces energy consumption and operational costs.
- The three-year construction phase is expected to begin after the summer of 2020.

morePerdaman Chemicals and Fertilisers (Perdaman) has signed a licensing and engineering contract for Haldor Topsoe’s[SynCOR Ammonia™ solution](https://www.topsoe.com/products/syncor-ammoniatm-new-process-grassroots-plants)for its A$ 4 billion ammonia/urea plant in Karratha, Western Australia. Stamicarbon has been chosen as urea licensor, and gas supply has been secured.  The next milestone for the project will be financial close, which is expected by the end of March 2020.

“This is a significant step forward for the Karratha Urea Project. We are now full steam ahead on this important project that will use the latest and best technologies available. We expect Haldor Topsoe’s innovative SynCOR Ammonia™ technology to deliver significant economies of scale that will contribute to making this world-scale plant exceptionally competitive,” said Mr. Vikas Rambal, Founding Chairman and Managing Director, Perdaman Group.

SynCOR Ammonia™ is the state-of-the-art solution for large-scale ammonia production. Using industry-proven technologies and catalysts, it sets a new standard for single-train capacities that can enable double-digit reductions in production cost. Contrary to conventional two-step reforming, SynCOR™ Ammonia uses a single-step autothermal reformer and reduces steam throughput by 80 percent. This enables exceptional economies of scale in large-scale grassroots ammonia plants.

“We are excited to continue our longstanding relation with Perdaman and support them in building a truly cutting-edge world-scale ammonia/urea plant. SynCOR Ammonia™ is an exciting advancement for the ammonia market and reinforces our conviction that SynCOR™ is the best choice for large-scale ammonia production,” says Ms. Amy Hebert, Deputy CEO and EVP Chemicals, Haldor Topsoe.

SynCOR™ technology can also be applied in the production of methanol, syngas, and synthetic gasoline.
