# UCC Shchekinoazot confirmed guaranteed operation parameters of world’s first IMAP™ methanol and ammonia co-production plant

*Published: January 28, 2019*

- In December, UCC Shchekinoazot (Tula region, Russia) successfully completed a test run of their newly erected methanol and ammonia co-production unit based on Haldor Topsoe’s IMAP Methanol+™ process.
- Production capacity is 450,000 tons of methanol and 135,000 tons of ammonia per year.
- The plant is the first greenfield project in the world to be based on Topsoe’s unique, flexible, andCO2neutral ammonia and methanol co-production process, IMAP™.

moreUCC Shchekinoazot has approved the results of a recent guarantee test run which confirmed that the plant delivered the guaranteed production volumes with the anticipated natural gas consumption. The test was supervised by Topsoe specialists, who verified that plant operated safely and as expected.

“We are pleased that the performance test has been concluded with a positive outcome. We opted for the IMAP™ co-production process because of its streamlined process layout with no shift reactors or CO2removal unit. Also, the flexibility of this technology allowed us to replace an aging ammonia production unit with the considerably more energy-efficient IMAP™ process, while further expanding our methanol production capacity,” says Anatoly Surba, CEO of Shchekinoazot.

The proprietary IMAP Methanol+™ process design is intended for use where methanol is the main product, ammonia is the co-product, and there is no need to produce urea. Ammonia production capacity ranges from 25 to 35 percent. IMAP™ technology (Integrated Methanol and Ammonia Production) also exists in versions that allow flexible co-production of larger shares of ammonia and/or urea.

“We are delighted to see the world’s first grassroots IMAP™ plant begin operation at our long-standing customer and partner UCC Shchekinoazot. Being part of their ongoing success story makes us proud, and even more so because they have invested in coproducing methanol and ammonia, which is a unique Topsoe technology,” says Peter Vang Christensen, Managing Director of Haldor Topsoe’s Moscow office.

Collaboration between UCC Shchekinoazot and Topsoe dates back to 2007 when the construction of the first methanol plant started – it was launched in 2011. In 2012, a hydrogen unit with the capacity of 26,000 Nm3/hr was built and commissioned. UCC Shchekinoazot is currently implementing their third methanol production plant under Topsoe license with a capacity of 500,000 tons of methanol per year.

Topsoe and Shchekinoazot also join forces in a joint social project – the Tolstoy, Topsoe and Sokol Families’ Foundation – that supports gifted children from families in challenging circumstances.
