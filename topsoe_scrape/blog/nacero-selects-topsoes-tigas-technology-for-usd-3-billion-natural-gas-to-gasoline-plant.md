# Nacero selects Topsoe’s TIGAS™ technology for USD 3 billion natural gas-to-gasoline plant

*Published: March 26, 2020*

- Nacero has signed agreements with Haldor Topsoe for basic engineering and license for a planned natural-gas-to-gasoline facility in Casa Grande, Arizona, with a capacity of 35,000 barrels-per-day of finished gasoline. Pending final investment decision, Topsoe will also supply proprietary hardware, catalysts, and services.
- The plant will use Topsoe’s proven TIGAS™ gas-to-gasoline technology to produce clean, high-value gasoline from low-cost natural gas. The gasoline meets local quality specifications.
- In May 2019, the world’s[first TIGAS™ natural gas-to-gasoline plant](/worlds-only-natural-gas-to-gasoline-plant-in-operation-in-turkmenistan)started production of 15,500 barrels-per-day of gasoline in Turkmenistan. This is the only large-scale natural gas-to-gasoline plant in the world. The owner and operator is Turkmengas, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Rönesans were EPC contractors.

moreGasoline from TIGAS™ is free of sulfur, cost-competitive, and seamlessly replaces traditional gasoline in car engines. The[TIGAS™ process](/worlds-only-natural-gas-to-gasoline-plant-in-operation-in-turkmenistan)utilizes large amounts of natural gas, which today is often vented or flared, and converts the gas into a useful product.

"By making an environmentally superior gasoline from natural gas rather than crude oil, Nacero will enable drivers to keep their cars and help the planet. Using existing vehicles, markets, infrastructure, and proven technology affords Nacero the opportunity to quickly and predictably create meaningful benefits at world-class scale," says Jay McKenna, CEO, Nacero.

*The world’s only large-scale natural gas-to-gasoline plant produces 15,500 barrels-per-day of gasoline. Nacero’s planned facility will have more than double that capacity.*

Nacero selected Haldor Topsoe and TIGAS™ after careful consideration of competing technologies. A highly influential factor was that the TIGAS™ technology is industry-proven and backed by a strong commitment from Topsoe. Topsoe initially developed the TIGAS™ technology and catalysts in the late 1970’s and has continuously improved the solution through an extensive R&D program for over 40 years.

“We are proud that Nacero has made TIGAS™ their technology of choice in their ambitious plan to bring gasoline security and jobs to Arizona. This cutting-edge technology will help communities and producers monetize natural gas resources, and reduce imports by producing high-quality gasoline locally,” says Kim Knudsen, Executive Vice President, Haldor Topsoe.

TIGAS™ comprises Topsoe’s proprietary and widely used[SynCOR Methanol™ technology](https://www.topsoe.com/products/syncor-methanoltm)that secures exceptional economy of scale. The Nacero plant will produce more than 10,000 metric tons per day (MTPD) of methanol, which is further processed to gasoline. The only byproduct from the process is purified water which is a valuable resource in the dry area.

The TIGAS™ process has a very high carbon efficiency, and the Nacero facility will have the flexibility to meet various specifications and grades of gasoline.
