# Topsoe increases prices on catalysts due to escalating raw material and energy prices

*Published: August 17, 2022*

As a result of the increasing cost of natural gas, electricity, and several key commodity chemicals used in our catalyst production process, Topsoe will have to increase prices across our catalyst product line. Depending on the product portfolio the price increases will be in the 5-15% range.

The price adjustments will take effect immediately.
