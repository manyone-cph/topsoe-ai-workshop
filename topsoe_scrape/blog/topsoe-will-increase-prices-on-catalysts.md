# Topsoe will increase prices on catalysts due to escalating raw material and energy prices

*Published: March 17, 2022*

As a result of the increasing raw material price of nonferrous metals, natural gas, electricity and other key raw materials used in our catalyst production process, Topsoe  will increase prices across our catalyst product line.

The general price adjustment will take effect immediately.
