# CO PRODUCTIONDECARBONIZED

#### Putting captured CO2to work for you

Topsoe eCOs™ (electrolytic carbon monoxide solution) enables safe, efﬁcient and reliable CO production right on site and directly from CO2. Built on a scalable, modular design, eCOs™ can meet the needs of  almost any facility that uses CO in its processes,  regardless of industry or size.eCOs™ CO2electrolysis offers major beneﬁts over traditional forms of CO sourcing, especially when  decarbonization is high on the agenda:•    Lets you dispose of CO2while producing CO•    Highly efﬁcient electrolyzer technology for a fast ROI•    Built to your capacity and purity needs up to 99.995%•    Field-proven electrolysis for large-scale production•    Supported by expert Topsoe services

## CO

#### Introducing Topsoe eCOs™

Centered on Topsoe’s proven SOEC electrolysis technology – powered by electricity alone – a Topsoe eCOs™ installation can convert virtually 100% of your captured CO2feedstock to CO. Each installation is built to give you the exact amount and purity of CO that your process requires – up to 99.995 vol%. The result is the right CO for your operation with signiﬁcantly reduced carbon emissions.eCOs™ is an exceptionally efﬁcient method of CO production thanks to a conversion process that is more direct and simpler than other methods. And Topsoe’s expert ﬁeld and advisory services are available to; support your installation from planning to decommissioning at the end of its lifecycle.

#### Your eCOs™ installation

An eCOs™ installation consists primarily of at least one SOEC electrolyzer section and a gas puriﬁcation section. CO2is fed into the electrolyzer, which converts the CO2into a CO-rich gas. This gas is led into the puriﬁcation section, which removes remaining CO2to achieve the purity your process requires. The removed CO2is fed back into the electrolyzer and used as additional feedstock, while the puriﬁed CO is sent to storage. Air or CO2is used as ﬂush gas on the oxy side of the electrolyzer and exits in an oxygen-enriched state.

#### Why SOEC electrolysis

Simpler, more straightforward and more predictable than traditional methods, SOEC converts CO2to CO with no need for fossil fuels but only electricity. In fact, SOEC is the only electrolysis technology suitable for efﬁcient CO2to CO conversion and has also achieved a higher TRL compared to low-temperature electrolyzers.

CO2electrolysis offers major benefits over traditional forms of CO sourcing, especially when decarbonization is high on the agenda.[DOWNLOAD THE BROCHURE TO KNOW MORE](https://engage.topsoe.com/y1530201441_lp?ctid=y1530201441)

#### Sell your CO2as CO

If you produce excess CO2, converting this to CO and selling the end product to other facilities can help you decarbonize while generating a new revenue stream.**Talk to your Topsoe representative to learn more.**
