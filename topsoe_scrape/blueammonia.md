**The fuel of the future is here**

With an energy transition burgeoning, the world’s demand for clean energy requires immediate action.

Blue ammonia has a significant role to play, helping to transform hard-to-abate sectors, such as transportation and power generation.

Partner with the leading ammonia specialists and benefit from proven technologies with superior scalability. We’re here to help you decarbonize efficiently and cost-effectively, so you can stay competitive while meeting the demands of tomorrow.

**Pathway Blue**

**The pathway to decarbonization starts with blue.**

Blue NH3is a responsible way of producing ammonia that integrates carbon capture to minimize GHG emissions. A high energy densityandan already established storage and transport infrastructure makeblue ammoniaan ideal energy carrier. And a low-carbon game changer.

**Demand for blue is rapidly growing**

The demand for ammonia is growing. Fast. Projected figures predict that the global ammonia market will grow by nearly 400 billion USD by 2050.

And production is expected to increase by 688 Mt, spurred by energy transport, thermal power generation, and maritime shipping sectors.

In addition to using ammonia as a direct fuel source, it is also an exceptional energy carrier set to disrupt the alternative energy industry. And our technologies will allow you to meet the increasing production requirements of a growing market while simultaneously lowering carbon intensity. Through Topsoe, you can protect your business with carbon-free fuel production at scale, comply with regulations, and become a company of the future.

**Now is thetime to produce**

Scale up production while minimizing risk. With our extensive ammonia production experience, you can diversify with certainty and get the flexibility to broaden your product portfolio successfully.

Regardless of the project, our blue ammonia solutions are key in opening the door to an economy of scale and a production capacity second to none.

**The proof is in the numbers.Like 99%+ carbon recovery.**

Achieving the best shade of blue ammonia depends on the carbon intensity (CI).

With our reforming technology, your operation can achieve an unrivalled CI with the lowest levelized cost. We enable an industry-leading 99%+ carbon emission reduction at mega scale, all under one single-point license. Increasing your profitability and returns on decarbonized energy production.

CO2capture is easier from the process gas or NWU off-gas rather than flue gas due to higher partial pressure.In SynCORTMblue ammonia technology, it is possible to achieve a CI lower than   0.01 kgCO2/kgNH3solely by capturing the CO2in the process.Topsoe does not offer POx technology.

**Integrate carbon capture with****SynCOR™ Ammonia**

SynCOR Ammonia™ is a breakthrough in the ammonia industry. Whereas traditional ammonia plants today rely on conventional two-step reforming. SynCOR Ammonia™ utilizes****the unique TOPSOE™ SynCOR™ solution, a process based on oxygen-fired autothermal reforming. Rather than tubular steam methane and an air-fired secondary reforming. Making CO2capture easier from the process gas or PSA off-gas compared to flue gas due to their higher partial pressure. Thus, achieving a CI lower than**0.1 kgCO2/kgH2**.

Blue Ammonia Fueling the Future Today

As the world transitions towards a sustainable  and carbon-neutral future, the need for clean  energy sources has become increasingly urgent.  Up until now, oil and fossil fuels are the dominant  feedstock for global scale energy export, import  and storage. However, the industrial transition,  driven by the global ambitions to limit greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions, and the continuous reduction  of renewable electricity costs, are changing the  landscape.

[Re]Route to better energy

Climate change is one of humanity’s biggest challenges, and the planet's demand for  low-carbon, high-purity energy products is at an all-time high. Hydrogen is often referred  to as ‘the fuel of the future' and is expected to play an important role in our strive towards  net zero.
