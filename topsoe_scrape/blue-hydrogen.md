**BLUE HYDROGEN**

Meet mega-scale challenges with mega-scale solutions

**No more talk. Let’s act now.**

The global climate consensus stage is long gone. The target-setting time is over. And decarbonization deadlines will soon pass us by.

That’s where blue hydrogen comes in. Let’s implement ultra-low carbon hydrogen and let’s use natural gas resources to do that. Because — make no mistake — natural gas has a huge role to play in reaching a low-carbon world.

**Global hydrogen production**

Major countries, regions, and organizations already have clear hydrogen strategies.The global blue hydrogen market is forecast to be worth USD 2.5 billion by 2027.So where will your business be when demand reaches its peak?With Topsoe, you can lead the way.

**HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BY SOURCE**

****

**Go big, go blue**

It’s clear: To meet increasing demands, the world needs to increaseproduction capacity.So why wait? Blue hydrogen is ready to deploy today.And, if you start now, you can be at the crest of a big blue wave.

Choose a blue hydrogen technology licensor that enables you to produce at any scale,from small- to mega-scale.In doing so, you’ll open up a world of opportunities for your business.

Let’s embrace unparalleled economy of scale and meet the massive global needwith Topsoe’s blue hydrogen technologies.

**COMPARISON OF BLUE HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES**

CO2capture is easier from the process gas or PSA off-gas rather than flue gas due to higher partial pressure.​

​In SynCORTMblue hydrogen technology, it is possible to achieve a CI lower than**0.1 kgCO****2****/kgH****2**solely by capturing the CO2in the process.  In eREACTTMthis is even lower.

**Choose ultra-low carbon technologies**

Go low. And then go lower. Achieving the best shade of blue all comes back to Carbon Intensity (CI): the lower the CI, the more sustainable the solution.And the good news? All our blue hydrogen technologies have incredibly low CI. Withreforming and CO2capture in onesingle-point license, weenable an industry-leading 99%+ carbon emission reduction.HubSpot Call-to-Action Code[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif][](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/2115834/1a103827-4ecd-427d-8bbf-f05f854df912)end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code

## eREACT - Let's power up blue!

Electrify your low-carbon hydrogen production with eREACT, the electrified counterpart to the world's most common hydrogen production method: steam methane reforming (SMR). By relying on (Renewable) electricity to drive the heat generation process, eREACT delivers ultra-low carbon intensity, and a remarkable reduction of over 99% in CO2 emissions compared to SMR. The enables you to support the energy transition with your existing hydrocarbon infrastructure (natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or naphtha), and future-proof your low-carbon production.

What if we said you could dramatically decarbonize your business, today? Well, with blue hydrogen, you can.

Electrified steam methane reforming of biogas for sustainable syngas  manufacturing and next-generation of plant design: A pilot plant study

Electrification of the traditional steam methane reforming (SMR) technology for syngas manufacturing has a  significant CO2 reduction potential and make it more feasible to operate in combination with carbon capture/  utilization, especially if renewable electricity is used. This pilot plant study demonstrates the first operational  experience with industrial-scale electrified steam methane reforming (eSMR) technology using biogas as sustainable carbon feedstock
