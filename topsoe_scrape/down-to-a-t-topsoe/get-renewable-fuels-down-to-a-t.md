Ten million commercial flights and more than 44 billion pounds of freight take to the skies above the U.S. every year. Add in more than 300 billion miles trucked across highways and 2 billion tons of maritimecargo, and you get a good sense of how important the transportation industry is to the American economy and to everyday life (sources:[Aviation](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/by_the_numbers),[Trucking](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2022/vm1.cfm?_gl=1*1ieluo8*_ga*MTM4ODcxNDQxNC4xNzI0MzQ0MDUy*_ga_VW1SFWJKBB*MTcyNDM0NDA1Mi4xLjAuMTcyNDM0NDA2MS4wLjAuMA.)and[Maritime)](https://www.bts.gov/product/freight-facts-and-figures).

It also highlights the challenge ahead to decarbonize energy-intensive sectors, and the opportunity that renewable fuels can help deliver – now. That’s because renewable fuels offer a viable pathway to reduce emissions, helping to meet climate targets while maintaining the functionality and reliability required by these critical industries.

Topsoe has the in-depth chemical processing expertise needed to deliver the complete package for our customers in these industries. With Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ technology, our customers can convert biomass-based feedstocks, such as waste oils, fats and greases, into high-quality renewable fuels.

One of the most exciting renewables applications in the U.S. is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 85% compared to conventional jet fuel. Topsoe has a range of proven technologies ready to help our customers produce SAF with several already commercially advanced production routes, including the production of renewable fuels from waste oils and fats, solid biomass, tires and discarded plastic.

**Zaffra, is a joint venture company focused on the development and delivery of SAF. Zaffra combines the extensive experience of Sasol in asset development, plant construction and robust operating and technology expertise and Topsoe’s proven carbon emission reduction technologies.**

Our process offers flexibility, high yields, low-carbon intensity and drop-in compatibility – producing renewable fuels that can be used directly in existing infrastructure and engines. In addition to SAF, we’re developing and commercializing sustainable solutions for producing other renewable fuels, such as renewable diesel.
