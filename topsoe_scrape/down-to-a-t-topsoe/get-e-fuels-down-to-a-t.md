Envisioning a future without steel, cement and long-distance transportation, seems unimaginable, and rightly so. From heavy industrial centers in the Northeast, across the long-haul routes through the Midwest, to the runways at LAX, these energy-intensive industries are not easily electrified. For us to reach net zero, it’s essential to address the fuels powering these industries with solutions – not only for the production of that fuel, but for the chemistry behind it.

Enter Electrofuels, or simply, “e-fuels.” Topsoe offers solutions for developing these synthetic fuels through Power-to-X (PtX) to produce green hydrogen, which can then be converted into green ammonia or eMethanol for use across multiple energy intensive industries. E-fuels have the same chemical properties as fossil-based fuels and, as a result, can be used as direct substitutes in existing infrastructure.

We’re one of only a few companies that offers the full Power-to-X value proposition, supported by our proprietary SOEC electrolyzer that offers between 20 and 30 percent higher efficiency than conventional electrolysis technology. The green hydrogen produced can power a wide spectrum of industries, including:

- Shipping and long-distance transportation
- Aviation
- Steel production
- Chemicals
