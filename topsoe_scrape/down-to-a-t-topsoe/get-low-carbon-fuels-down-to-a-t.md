Low-carbon fuels offer a solution to help keep U.S. industry at the forefront of the energy transition while generating economic opportunity in the process. Low-carbon, or “blue,” hydrogen is produced by combining traditional hydrogen production methods with carbon capture technologies. The hydrogen can then be transformed into low-carbon ammonia or methanol. Through carbon capture and storage technologies (CCUS), process emissions are captured, stored or further utilized, enabling a low-carbon approach to hydrogen production.

**In North America, more than 70% of announced hydrogen project capacity is low-carbon as a result of low-cost natural gas and sequestration resources.**

At Topsoe, our low-carbon technologies are available, proven and scalable today. We offer a range of options to tackle the challenge of reducing emissions in our customers’ operations.

- **SynCOR™**: Topsoe’s proprietary technology is the most mature production solution available for blue hydrogen and blue ammonia. Supported by more than 300 years of accumulative, safe operation, SynCOR is based on a unique autothermal reforming process that enables high efficiency, low emissions, flexibility and scalability.
- **eREACT™**: Topsoe’s versatile technology for the production of low-carbon hydrogen and fuels, leveraging new production routes that combine renewable electricity and natural gas while eliminating flue gas emissions.
