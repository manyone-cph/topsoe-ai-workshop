# What are SAF TALKSTM?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) continues to be recognized as a crucial solution for driving down the CO2 emissions of the aviation industry. And yet, SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of the global jet fuel consumption.

To fuel knowledge sharing of what it'll take to scale-up SAF, we've composed a second season of SAF TalksTMfilmed during our second SAF Summit in Copenhagen in November 2023.

In a total of 8 bite-sized videos, frontrunners from across the SAF value chain share their latest trends and insights. And trust us! The industry is far from being at a standstill with numerous development underway...

**SAF employment: Perspectives of an aviation fuel distributor**

*Featuring Sune Petersen, Head of Sustainability and Strategy at DCC & Shell Aviation Denmark and Asmara Klein, Senior Public Affairs Officer, Topsoe.*

Get ready to hear directly from the aviation fuel distributors themselves! DCC & Shell Aviation Denmark, a distributor of aviation fuel, plays a key role in the supply chain of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In 2021, they introduced their first SAF product, and today, they’re exploring a storage facility at Copenhagen Airport capable of accommodating millions of liters of SAF. In this SAF Talk, we explore their initiatives to promote and implement SAF within Danish airports, including how they have sought partnerships across the entire supply chain to create value for all stakeholders involved.

**Flight plan to net-zero 202**

*Featuring Patrick Edmond, CEO at Altair Advisory and Milica Folic, Director, Clean Fuels and Chemicals Technology, Topsoe.*

With the urgent need to decarbonize, the aviation industry finds itself in a challenging position. The question arises: how will the industry achieve net zero emissions? While there’s a consensus that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) will play an essential role as the primary catalyst for change, there are issues that need tackling before we can safely take off towards our decarbonized future. Get the full overview of all the levers we can pull (and the potential blockers surrounding them) to get the aviation industry to net-zero emissions by 2050 in this SAF Talk.

**The potential of certification**

*Featuring Matthieu Boisson, Managing Director at CertifHy and Sylvain Verdier, Senior Strategy Manager, Topsoe.*

Certification can be a stamp of approval that a product meets the expected standards. For renewable, low-carbon and e-fuels, certification can act as an essential tool for demonstrating the sustainability of the production and end-product. In this SAF Talk, we explore the complex world of certification with the help of Matthieu Boisson, Managing Director of CertifHy, a company that specializes in renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and e-fuel certification.

**Taking SAF technologies from lab to lift-off**

*Featuring Mariano Berkenwald, Senior Associate at Breakthrough Energy and Mathias Bøje Madsen, Business Development Manager, Topsoe*

The global development of technologies for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production is on rise. However, simply focusing on development is insufficient. To decarbonize aviation, we must ensure that these technologies are deployed at commercial scale. This is where Breakthrough Energy comes in. Founded by Bill Gates, Breakthrough Energy is an organization that aims to accelerate both development and deployment of the technologies necessary for out net zero future, which last year included their first investment into a SAF plant. Join us as we venture to understand Breakthrough Energy's perspectives on scaling up investments in SAF projects and get a little taste of their own project selection criteria.

**The net-zero paradox of airlines**

*Featuring Daniel Bloch, SAF Specialist at The International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Sylvain Verdier, Senior Strategy Manager, Topsoe.*

SAF presents a paradox for airlines as they navigate the transition to a net-zero future. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is expected to crush 65% of aviation emissions by 2050, making this renewable fuel the insurance policy for the continued operation of airlines. However, SAF also brings commercial anxiety for airlines, as it has the potential to impact their already low profit margins, currently averaging around $2.25 per passenger. Amid this paradox, it is vital to understand the preferences and approaches of the industry and explore the industry's perspectives on de-risking strategies and production methods for SAF. This SAF Talk sets out to do just that!

**Non-CO2 emissions and the role of SAF in tackling them**

*Featuring Rocio Gonzales Sanchez, Policy Manager at Clean air Task Force and Sylvain Verdier, Senior Strategy Manager, Topsoe*

A new term is taking wings within aircraft emissions: non-CO*2*effects. Non-CO*2*effects are climate change contributors beyond CO*2*, such as contrails, nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, water vapor, and aerosols. And potentially amounting to two-thirds of the climate impact from air travel, non-CO*2*emissions shouldn’t just be left to fly. A mitigation of these effects is simply imperative for our strive for sustainable air travel. But how do we minimize these? What will be the impact on airlines and traffic? And which role will sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) play? This SAF Talk has the answers you need!

**Securing future SAF supply: Insights from an airline**

*Featuring Kristoffer Gustavsen, Public Affairs and Sustainability Manager at Norwegian Air Shuttle and Sylvain Verdier, Senior Strategy Manager, Topsoe*

Gazing into the future, a shortage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from 2030 has caught the attention of Norwegian Air Shuttle (Norwegian). As a smaller airline, Norwegian has, therefore, taken the reins to secure their own supply of SAF. Join us as we delve into Norwegian's comprehensive approach to achieving their ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010, all while maintaining their commitment to affordability and reliability for Nordic customers.

**The ideal policy approach for ramping up SAF**

*Featuring Tom Berg, Policy and Sustainability Manager at SkyNRG and Sylvain Verdier, Senior Strategy Manager, Topsoe*

Let's explore the policy approaches taken in the EU, UK, and US for ramping up SAF. The three major regions all have three very different approaches to SAF. The EU has taken the lead with its ReFuelEU Aviation, but despite ambitious mandates targeting 70% SAF by 2050, we've yet to see a surge in projects reaching final investment decision (FID). So, the big question remains: what does the ideal policy for ramping up SAF look like? And what other de-risking instruments could supplement ambitious mandates to truly accelerate SAF production?

This report provides a comprehensive review of the opportunities and challenges for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) adoption, featuring leading experts from across the value chain.
