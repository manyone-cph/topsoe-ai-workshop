## Wherever American energy is in transition, you’ll find us.

Energy intensive industries and long-distance transportation account for more than 30% of U.S. carbon emissions. Addressing the carbon challenge of these sectors is not only our duty – but also essential to reach net zero by 2050. We know that the road forward is not paved by any single idea or technology. Like most global challenges, the energy transition will be realized through an energy system that is equitable, sustainable and scalable.

As a leading global provider of energy transition technologies and solutions, we can help American companies decarbonize at scale and meet their emission reduction goals. We turn renewable resources into efficient fuels and chemicals for a sustainable future. Guiding your company toward a new American energy reality.

#### E-FUELS

Power-to-X (PtX) is the bridge between the world’s most carbon-intensive industries and a net zero future. At Topsoe, we have the solutions needed to produce e-fuels by producing green hydrogen via electrolysis. We can then convert the hydrogen to either ammonia, methanol or e-SAF through our Power-to-X solutions for use across multiple energy intensive industries.
