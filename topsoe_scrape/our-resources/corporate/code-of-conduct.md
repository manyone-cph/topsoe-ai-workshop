# CODE OF  CONDUCT

At Topsoe we are committed to conducting our business in a sustainable, responsible and compliant manner. We comply with applicable laws and maintain high ethical standards, as described in our Topsoe Code of Conduct and underlying internal policies and procedures.

Topsoe’s Code of Conduct sets out the conduct and behavior  that we at Topsoe expect of each other and seek out in our  business partners, and it addresses the issues that are most  critically important for our business. At Topsoe we are committed to conducting business in an ethical, safe, and sustainable manner, complying with all  applicable laws, regulations, and other  stakeholder requirements, and applying responsible standards  where relevant laws and regulations are lacking. Our Code of Conduct is our commitment to our customers, business partners,  and other stakeholders, and a guide and reminder to every  Topsoe employee worldwide.
