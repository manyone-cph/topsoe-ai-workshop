# HISTORY

#### **A HISTORY OF TAKING ON THE WORLD’S TOUGHEST CHALLENGES**

When Dr. Haldor Topsøe founded the company in 1940, he based it on two things: A passion for science and a determination to make a positive difference in the world. We stay true to his legacy.

We’re dedicated to solving the world’s biggest challenges through science and innovation – and throughout our history, we’ve done exactly that.

When growing up as a young man in the 1920s and 1930s, Dr. Haldor Topsøe saw many challenges. People starving and queueing up outside the grocery stores. As a young scientist, he felt he needed to do something. Because he could. This led him to establish the company Haldor Topsøe.

Dr. Haldor Topsøe’s interest in chemistry and catalysis was sparked during his study of physics with the prominent professor, Niels Bohr, at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. That’s where Dr. Haldor Topsøe first saw the potential of catalysis, which would become the basis of the company.

Back then catalysis was a little-used chemical process, but Dr. Haldor Topsøe believed that one day it could serve a huge, unmet industrial need and benefit the world.

From the very beginning, our ammonia solutions have supported fertilizer production that has secured food for growing populations.

When air pollution threatened environmental stability and public health, our technologies helped reduce sulfur and other pollutants from fossil fuel emissions to environmentally safe levels.

Already in 1988, Dr. Haldor Topsøe predicted the climate challenges faced today:

“*I wish you would understand that the greenhouse effect will reach a point of no return, but we can postpone this through a more efficient use of fossil fuels and continued expansion of renewable energy*.”

Today, we providetechnology for the energy transition and leading solutions for the decarbonization of fuels.

Dr. Haldor Topsøe’s contributions were recognized with many honors. These included the Eminent Chemical Engineer Award in Delhi in 1997. In 1999, he was awarded the engineer of the century in Denmark for his devotion to chemical engineering and his determination to make science serve humanity and our planet.

Dr. Haldor Topsøe passed away in 2013, just 4 days before he turned 100, but his spirit lives on in Topsoe.

The world has changed immensely and will continue to do so, but the vision Dr. Haldor Topsøe founded his company on is ever significant and the backbone of our company.
