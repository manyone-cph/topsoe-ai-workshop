### Roeland Baan

#### President and CEO

Roeland Baan joined Topsoe as President and CEO in 2020 with a clear focus on establishing the company as a leader in technologies and solutions for the energy transition. He is leading the company’s nearly 3,000 employees across a dozen countries in rewriting the future of fuels production.

“To reach net zero, we need to forge partnerships across the value chain and focus on leveraging the solutions we have at hand. We are dedicated to helping our customers and partners achieve their decarbonization and emission reduction goals through our world-leading technologies and solutions for transforming renewable resources into fuels for a sustainable future.”

Roeland engages in dialogues and forums with other key opinion leaders to identify and deploy solutions that enable the global energy transition. He often shares his perspectives on matters ranging from decarbonization of energy-intensive industries to electrolyzer capacity, new technologies that support carbon emission reductions, and the challenges and regulatory frameworks needed to achieve a fair and inclusive green energy transition.

Roeland has more than 40 years of experience developing businesses, supporting customer relationships, driving growth, building cohesive organizations and amassing deep operational and strategic knowledge across the energy, fuel and steel industries. Prior to joining Topsoe, he was President and CEO of Outokumpu, a producer of stainless steel, and before that CEO of rolled and extruded products at aluminum manufacturer Aleris. Roeland also held leadership positions at Arcelor Mittal, SHV NV and Shell.

He serves as Chairman of SBM Offshore NV and is member of the Syensqo Board of Directors and the Hydrogen Council Board.

Roeland earned a M.S. in economics from Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam.
