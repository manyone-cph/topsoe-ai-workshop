# WEWELCOMESTUDENTS

## It’s exciting to be exploring new technologies with the potential to solve global challenges - and create a better future for everyone.

At Topsoe, your knowledge counts. Maybe it even makes a difference. We are always looking for committed, innovative and ambitious students who can take part in relevant projects or apply for our available jobs. At Topsoe you will get an insight into catalytic chemistry and into how to use the catalysis, e.g. in energy technology, oil refinery, and in the cleaning of the emission from trucks and the smoke from the power plants.​

## Projects at Topsoe

Explore our[Available Jobs](/our-resources/people/careers/available-jobs)to find student relevant jobs or use our[Contact Form](/contact?hsCtaTracking=4d39833c-e59b-470c-9711-f7f3be800596%7Cd33c0327-23bb-430c-b69c-3bbb92390f8a)to apply for student project opportunities at Topsoe. Please provide a brief description (4-5 lines) of your project idea, and if we have an opening that aligns with it, we will get in touch with you.

As a student, you will be assigned to a project group or department where you form part of a dynamic working process. We will give your project the same attention as the other tasks and challenges we are facing because your project is relevant.

You will be assigned a supervisor or mentor, who will help and guide you through the project – student supervision is a task we take seriously. Several students are involved in project work in Topsoe contributing to a dynamic and dedicated environment.

## Activities for Students

At Topsoe you have the opportunity to acquaint yourself with catalysis – how does catalysis play a role in day-to-day life and in the energy technological processes. Every year we are present at different fairs and activities related to primary and high schools such as Science in Forum (Denmark) and Girls day in science (Denmark).

It is important for us to let students get an insight into what Topsoe does and how catalysis contributes to solving the challenges of the future regarding environment and energy.  Furthermore, the students have a glimpse of what an education within science can lead to.

Topsoe has a close cooperation with universities and university students from the entire world. We receive visits from university students who learn about how our catalysts help making the world a better place. The content of the visits ranges broadly, from basic science in Nanostructures catalysis to development of new processes for design and construction of the industrial plants.

Please make sure to visit us at the job and career fairs at DSE (DTU Denmark), Kula (Sweden), Arkad (Sweden) and CBS (Denmark).

Every year laboratory and technical schools visit Topsoe. The visits include a general introduction to the company and catalysis and a tour of our laboratories where you will meet our employees to learn about their everyday life in Topsoe.

At Topsoe we have a long tradition of cooperating with a number of laboratory and technical schools in Denmark. We sit in an education committee for laboratory workers and we make sure that the program has the necessary and relevant content.

Topsoe engages each year in case studies with technical schools in Denmark to develop their knowledge about our products and technologies.
