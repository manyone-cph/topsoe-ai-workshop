## Degradation of metals and coatings at high temperatures

In the energy sector high temperature corrosion of metals due to oxidation, sulfidation, carburization and metal dusting is a major concern.

The project investigates the degradation of high alloyed materials and coatings at temperatures above 1000°C under oxidation conditions.

Key parameters of the project include:

- Characterization of the oxide films formed
- Grain growth of the base metal
- Changes in phase composition
- Formation of brittle precipitates
- Interdiffusion between base metals and coatings
- Disbanding of coatings

The following techniques were used:

- Heat treatments under controlled conditions
- Preparation of metallographic specimens
- Light optical microscopy
- Scanning electron microscopy
- Electron dispersive X-ray analyses
- X-ray diffractometry
- Microhardness measurement
