# PLANTOPTIMIZATION

If you want to achieve best-in-class performance and the profitability that goes with it, a TopsoeTMPlant Optimization training course will give you the insight you need.

With an emphasis on improving practices, uncovering plant potential and taking full advantages of TopsoeTMtechnical services, our flexible, tailored Plan Optimization course will help you squeeze more value out of your investments in catalysts and plant equipment. As with all TOPSOETMtechnical training, this course leverages our unique position as both catalyst supplier and technology licensor to give you efficiency-boosting insight you won't find anywhere else

**What does the Training Course cover?**

- Insight into the dependencies in your plant that can cause bottle-necks when trying to optimize
- Step-by-step guide to assessing the performance of your plant's key equipment and catalysts (e.g., reformers, the reformer waste heat section, adiabatic reactors, heat exchangers, the synthesis loop)
- Understanding of how different plant components can be optimized and how individual adjustments affect overall performance
- Workshop on how to optimize plant performance by either reducing energy consumption or increasing production
