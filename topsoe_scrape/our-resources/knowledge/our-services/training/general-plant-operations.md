# GENERAL PLANTOPERATION

It normally takes years to acquire a solid feel for how to operate a plant. The TOPSOE™ General Plant Operation training course will give you a head start, making you an “early expert” and helping you get more value out of future practical experience.

As with all TOPSOE™ technical training, this course leverages our unique position as both catalyst supplier and technology licensor to give you efficiency-boosting insight you won’t find anywhere else.
