# GENERAL PLANTSTART-UP

A trouble-free start-up is the first step towards a profitable production cycle. A TOPSOE™ Plant Start-up training course will help you prepare and execute your start-ups more efficiently and safely.

During start-up, plants need to pay close attention to their equipment and their catalysts, and it is also important to focus on how different parts of the plant interact. Our flexible, tailored Plant Start-up course covers everything you need to think about before your next plant start-up. As with all TOPSOE™ technical training, this course leverages our unique position as both catalyst supplier and technology licensor to give you efficiency-boosting insight you won’t find anywhere else.

**What does the Training Course cover?**

- Knowledge of how to execute a safe, effective plant start-up
- Understanding of different ways to start a plant, and their respective advantages and disadvantages
- Understanding of problems that can arise during start-up, including their causes and potential consequences and ways to prevent or remedy them
