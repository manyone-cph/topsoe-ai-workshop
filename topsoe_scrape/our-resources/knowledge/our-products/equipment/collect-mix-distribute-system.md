# EQUIPMENT

TOPSOE™’s Collect-Mix-Distribute system ensures efficient addition of quench between adiabatic catalytic beds.The CMD system Collects the effluent gas from the upstream catalyst bed, Mixes it with the quench gas, and then Distributes the mixed gas across the downstream catalyst bed.The improved mixing and distribution of the gas results in a more uniform reaction profile and a higher conversion.The CMD system is typically used in connection with revamps of quench reactors in methanol plants of older design.
