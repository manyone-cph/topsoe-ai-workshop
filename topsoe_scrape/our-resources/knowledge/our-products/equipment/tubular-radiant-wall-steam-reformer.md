# EQUIPMENT

The radiant wall steam reformer consists of a number of catalyst tubes in a single line in one or two fired boxes with burners placed at the walls at several elevations.

The burner flames are directed backwards against the furnace wall, eliminating any risk of flame impingement of the catalyst tubes. This burner arrangement enables full control of the temperature profile along the entire catalyst tube length. Therefore, the radiant wall steam reformer is able to operate at low steam to carbon ratios, unmatched high average heat fluxes, and at high outlet temperatures.

TOPSOE™’s radiant wall steam reformer design has been in operation for more than 50 years and we have designed more than 250 units.
