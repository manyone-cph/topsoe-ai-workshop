# EQUIPMENT

The methanol decomposition reactor typically contains a tube bundle with a couple of dozens to a few thousand tubes. The catalyst is loaded into the tubes which are heated from the shell side by a heat transfer fluid – typically oil. TOPSOE™ has designed methanol decomposition reactors for more than 30 years.
