# EQUIPMENT

Our Quench Mixer ensures efficient mixing of catalyst bed effluents from both above and from the cold quench stream.

Depending on the specific unit requirements, we offer three mixer types:

- Vortex
- Compression Ring
- Torusâ„¢

Our Quench Mixers are designed to achieve optimal mixing during all phases, while minimizing the pressure drop over the mixer.
