# EQUIPMENT

TOPSOE™ was the first technology licensor to introduce the multibed radial flow converter design, thereby improving conversion per pass compared to known technology.

The TOPSOE™ S-200 ammonia synthesis converter is a two-bed radial flow converter with indirect cooling between the catalyst beds. Since the introduction of the S-200 converter type in 1976, it has been used in more ammonia plants than any other converter design, with more than 130 converters installed worldwide.

The S-200 concept can still be supplied to existing users of S-200 baskets and for new plants where the two-bed solution is the optimal choice.
