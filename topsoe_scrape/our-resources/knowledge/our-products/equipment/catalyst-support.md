# EQUIPMENT

Our Catalyst Support is designed to support the combined weight of the catalyst, support material and oil. It can also withstand pressure drop over the catalyst bed during the entire catalyst cycle.

Inverted support beams support the catalyst grid to minimize inactive reactor volume.

Removable catalyst screens increase maintenance flexibility and minimized gasket requirements reduce maintenance time.
