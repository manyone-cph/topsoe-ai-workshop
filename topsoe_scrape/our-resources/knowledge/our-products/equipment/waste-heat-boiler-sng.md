# EQUIPMENT

The heat released in the methanation steps in the substitute natural gas (SNG) plants are recovered by high-pressure steam production in a number of waste heat boilers (WHB). The steam is further superheated in[Steam Superheaters (SSH)](/products/equipment/steam-superheaters-sng)to support utilization in steam turbines.

The WHB for SNG is designed and built based on TOPSOE™’s extensive experience with delivery of large process gas waste heat boilers for synthesis production (+link to Waste Heat Boiler (Syngas)). As the WHB for SNG requires process gas temperature control, the design will in each case have to be custom-made, involving advanced Finite Element Analysis to verify pressure vessel code compliance.

## Benefits

- Optimal heat recovery will be achieved with WHB and SSH in combination
- Temperature control of WHB ensuring safe and uniform process gas temperatures into SSH
- Reliable design meeting international and local codes and regulations
- Thermal and mechanical design based on proven and well-referenced principles
- Strict manufacturing requirements and quality control ensures a highly reliable boiler with a long life time
