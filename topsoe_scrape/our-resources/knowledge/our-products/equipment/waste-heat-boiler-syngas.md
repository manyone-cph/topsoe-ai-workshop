# EQUIPMENT

The process gas waste heat boiler (WHB) is a critical piece of equipment cooling the hot synthesis gas exiting an[ATR](/products/equipment/syncortm-autothermal-reformer-atr), a secondary reformer, or an SMR. The heat from the process gas is utilized to generate high pressure and high-quality steam for the process and to drive turbines.

Depending on the downstream processes and the need for accurate temperature control, the WHB can be designed with one or two compartments and combined with a[steam superheater](/products/equipment/steam-superheaters-ammonia-and-methanol)and/or configured with an internal bypass if required. In this way, a variety of process concepts becomes feasible and can be optimized to suit the specific plant needs.

The TOPSOE™ WHB is based on a thin flexible tube sheet combined with a unique thermal protection of the tube sheet, the tube-to-tube sheet weld, and the tube inlet. This protection is essential to avoid long-term degradation of the boiler from high temperatures and highly corrosive gases.

As a synthesis gas producer, you would demand a high reliability of all critical equipment. TOPSOE™ has a long reference list of boilers designed and delivered for even very severe conditions. Our strict manufacturing requirements and quality control ensure that the TOPSOE™ proprietary WHB is robust, reliable, and supports a long life.
