# CATALYSTS

## Oxygen fired secondary and autothermal reforming catalyst

RKA-02 is a nickel based top layer catalyst for oxygen fired secondary and autothermal reformers.

## Application

RKA-02 is used as a top layer catalyst for oxygen fired secondary and autothermal reformers above a main catalyst bed of RKS-type catalyst.

## Top layer catalyst

RKA-02 is used as a top layer catalyst which for the loading scheme: RKA-02,[RKS-2](/products/catalysts/rks-2), and[RKS-2-7H](/products/catalysts/rks-2-7h). The combined loading scheme gives the optimal performance with regard to conversion and pressure drop.
