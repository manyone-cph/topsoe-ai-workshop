# CATALYSTS

TK-733 is a demetallization (HDM) catalyst with moderate hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity for fixed-bed resid service. TK-733 is typically used for the reduction of metals, asphaltenes and Conradson Carbon as a first-stage catalyst in composite catalyst fillings. The optimized pore system and high pore volume allow enhanced metals pick-up while maintaining activity.

## Application

HDS/HDM of resid, fixed-bed composite catalyst fillings
