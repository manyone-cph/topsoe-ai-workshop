# CATALYSTS

Catalyst specifically developed for Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) pretreatment applications. TK-562 BRIM® provides the highest possible hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) activity along with aromatic saturation and some conversion into lighter products. The pore structure gives high catalyst stability when processing both straight-run and cracked Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) fractions.

## Application

Processing of VGOs for FCC pretreating
