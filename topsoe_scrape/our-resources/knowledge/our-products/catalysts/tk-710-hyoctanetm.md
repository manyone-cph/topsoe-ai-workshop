# CATALYSTS

TK-710 HyOctane™ is a CoMo type catalyst for Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) gasoline post-treatment. The catalyst has optimized hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity, limited loss of octane and high tolerance for metal poisoning. TK-710 HyOctane™ displays superior functionality for application in the HDS reactor(s) in the FCC gasoline post-treatment unit. The catalyst can achieve Ultra Low Sulfur Gasoline (ULSG), while minimizing octane loss.

TK-710 HyOctane™ is part of TOPSOE™’s series of HyOctane catalysts that are specifically developed for all steps in FCC gasoline post-treatment applications.

Other catalysts in this series are[TK-703 HyOctane™](https://www.topsoe.com/products/catalysts/tk-703-hyoctanetm?hsLang=en)and[TK-747 HyOctane™](https://www.topsoe.com/products/catalysts/tk-747-hyoctanetm?hsLang=en).

Their optimized activity and selectivity enable removal of sulfur to ultra-low levels while retaining high octane numbers, allowing a stable, flexible, and profitable production of high-quality gasoline.

## Application:

It is applied in Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) gasoline post-treatment.
