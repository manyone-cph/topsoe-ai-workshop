# CATALYSTS

TK-921 is part of TOPSOE™’s hydrocracking red series developed for maximum hydrogenation. This is an amorphous hydrocracking catalyst with high selectivity for middle distillates. TK-921 provides high end point reduction at low conversion and hydrogenation of the heavy end of the feed, as well as ring opening of naphthenes to form paraffins. It is specifically suitable for hydroprocessing of Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) streams to be used for lube oil base stock production.

## Application

- Hydrocracking
- Fischer-Tropsch wax processing
