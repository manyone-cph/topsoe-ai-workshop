# CATALYSTS

TK-361 is developed for fixed bed hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) service. The catalyst is typically applied as bulk catalyst in hydrotreating units, processing mixtures of diesel and high nitrogen containing renewable fuels. TK-361 is characterized by very high HDN activity, and at the same time, high activities of HDO, HDS, and aromatic saturation. Often, TK-361 is applied in combination with dewaxing catalysts.
