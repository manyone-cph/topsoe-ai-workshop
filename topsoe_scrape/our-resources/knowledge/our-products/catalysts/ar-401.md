# CATALYSTS

## Prereforming catalyst

AR-401 is a nickel catalyst on activated magnesium alumina spinel support. AR-401 is available in the following shapes:

- Cylinder (4.5mm x 4.5mm)
- 7 hole cylinder (11mm x 6mm, 2mm holes)

## Application

AR-401 is installed in an adiabatic reactor prior to a tubular reformer or autothermal reformer and used for pre-conversion of hydrocarbon feeds ranging from natural gas to naphtha.

## Extensive operating window

Due to the combination of the structure of the carrier material and the nickel crystallite size in the AR-401 catalyst, it has an extensive operating window. The high activity ensures effective conversion. It is suitable for low as well as high temperature prereforming and it can operate at very low steam carbon.
