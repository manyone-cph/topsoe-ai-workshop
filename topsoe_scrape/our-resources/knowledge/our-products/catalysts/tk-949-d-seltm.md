# CATALYSTS

TK-949 D-sel™ is part of TOPSOE™’s hydrocracking D-sel™ series for maximum diesel yields. TK-949 D-sel™ is a zeolitic NiW catalyst with high selectivity for middle distillates. It can be used in applications where high cracking activity and high middle distillate yield are required.

As a result of a novel production technology, TK-949 D-sel™ provides excellent middle distillate yield with low yield of light ends.

## Application

- Hydrocracking
