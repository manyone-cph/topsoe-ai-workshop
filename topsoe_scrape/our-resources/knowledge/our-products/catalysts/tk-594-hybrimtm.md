# CATALYSTS

TK-594 HyBRIMTMbelongs to the new trimetallic generation of extremely high-active catalysts based on the novel HyBRIMTMtechnology. It provides exceptionally high hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity, along with aromatic saturation and conversion into lighter products. The enhanced aromatic saturation improves the product density and yield a high volume swell for the liquid product. The HyBRIMTMtechnoloigy process ensures a unique porosity and porestructure which lead to high catalyst stability when processing both straight-run and cracked distillates/VGO fractions.

TK-594 HyBRIMTMis optimized to yield the highest desulfurization and denitrogenation volume activity when applied in high pressure mild hydrocrackers, FCC pretreaters and diesel applications.

## Application

- Diesel hydrotreating
- FCC Pretreatment
- Mild Hydrocracking

Growing interest in processing heavy oils with high nitrogen content has created a  need for pretreatment catalysts with higher HDN and HDS activity
