# CATALYSTS

TK‑580 HyBRIM™ is the latest generation, high-activity CoMo catalyst which has significantly higher activity than the past generation of catalysts for ultra-low sulfur diesel (less than 10 wt ppm sulfur). TK‑580 HyBRIM™ is based on the novel HyBRIM™ technology and is the superior choice for hydrotreating units operating at low-to-medium pressure. TK‑580 HyBRIM™ is suitable for a broad range of straight-run and cracked distillate fractions.
