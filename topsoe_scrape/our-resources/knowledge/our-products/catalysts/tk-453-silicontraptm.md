# CATALYSTS

TK-453 SiliconTrap™ is a NiMo catalyst with very high rates for removal of metals (Ni, V, Fe) and silicon, and it is an excellent guard in hydrotreaters that process heavy feeds. It exhibits moderate hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) activities. The pore size distribution and pore volume have been optimized, resulting in a high capacity for accumulation of nickel, vanadium and silicon.
