# CATALYSTS

## Zinc oxide absorbent

The diverse feedstocks in use today have made variations in gas composition and concentration commonplace, and technologies that protect downstream catalysts from poisoning are increasingly important.

The HTZ-5 is a high-purity, large-surface-area zinc oxide absorbent for feedstocks with low sulfur concentrations, or for operation at low temperatures. It reliably removes sulfur to keep your downstream catalysts protected.

## Advantages

- High sulfur capacity
- Unmatched zinc oxide purity
- Cost-effective, reliable performance

## Technical specs

- Size: 4 mm
- Shape: Extrudate
- ZnO: >99 wt%
- Typical temperature range: 200–400°C

## High capacity, long lifetime

With low sulfur concentrations or at low temperatures, diffusional limitations can create a long absorption front and reduce the absorbent’s lifetime. The HTZ-5 features an optimized surface area and pore structure that keep sulfur and chemisorption capacities high, for a longer lifetime and long-lasting protection.

## 99% zinc oxide purity

In addition to an optimized design, the HTZ-5 is produced using only the highest-quality zinc oxide. The result is unmatched zinc oxide purity – exceeding 99% – which means a very high sulfur capacity and assurance that no impurities from the absorbent will poison sensitive downstream catalysts.

## Cost-effective and reliable

TOPSOE™ HTZ absorbents have been proving their value for over 45 years, with thousands of charges supplied and customer feedback showing consistent high quality.

Cost-effective and proven reliable, the HTZ-5 is your best choice for protecting downstream catalysts in low-sulfur or low-temperature environments.
