# CATALYSTS

## Tubular reforming catalyst

A non-alkali catalyst for steam reforming.

## Application

The RC-67 TITAN™ is a non-alkali steam reforming catalyst with a carrier based on the robust hibonite calcium aluminate phase. A 100% loading of TITAN™ can be used for reforming of lighter feedstocks; for reforming of heavier feeds, TITAN™ can be installed below TOPSOE™’s alkali-promoted catalysts.

## Stable activity

The hibonite-based RC-67 TITAN™ features unmatched mechanical stability across the entire reforming temperature range. The addition of TiO2and the development of novel impregnation techniques have resulted in a high-performance catalyst that more stable towards sintering than competing calcium aluminate products.
