# CATALYSTS

Replacing TK-439, TK-449 SiliconTrap™has the highest silicon pick-up capacity of all the TK-400 series catalysts. This catalyst is used as a guard bed catalyst in units with severe silicon contamination.

TK-449 SiliconTrap™ does not contain any metals and should therefore be used in combination with[TK-447 SiliconTrap™](/products/catalysts/tk-447-silicontraptm)and/or[TK-441 SiliconTrap™](/products/catalysts/tk-441-silicontraptm)if desulfurization and denitrifications are also required.

The catalyst system should be designed with an optimized graded bed system to minimize pressure drop on top of a combination of[TK-441 SiliconTrap™](/products/catalysts/tk-441-silicontraptm),[TK-447 SiliconTrap™](/products/catalysts/tk-447-silicontraptm)and TK-449 SiliconTrap™. This will result in a significantly longer cycle length of any coker naphtha unit compared with operation on other typical naphtha hydrotreating catalysts.
