# CATALYSTS

## Secondary and autothermal reforming catalyst

RKS-2-7H is a nickel based reforming Â catalyst for secondary and autothermal reforming.

## Application

RKS-2-7H is used in the main bed of secondary and autothermal reformers.

## High activity and low pressure drop

The carrier of RKS-2-7H is magnesium aluminum spinel which shows unmatched thermal stability at reforming conditions. The RKS-2-7H catalyst has high activity and the shape and size gives low start-of-run pressure drop.RKS-2-7H may be used in the whole reformer bed or together with a suitable top layer depending on the operating conditions.
