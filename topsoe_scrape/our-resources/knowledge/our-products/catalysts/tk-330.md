# CATALYSTS

The TK-330 ensures that your intermediate-product quality is maximized after the phosphorus-trap action of the TK-3000. Medium HDO activity can be expected, accompanied by high double-bond saturation levels. This helps prevent pressure-drop and safeguards against carbon buildup. It also ensures high selectivity along the HDO route, thereby contributing to increased yield.
