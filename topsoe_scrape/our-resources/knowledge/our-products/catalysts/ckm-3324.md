# CATALYSTS

The CKM-3324 catalyst are based on oxides of copper and manganese on an alumina, silica or cordierite carrier. They are a cost effective solutions in many applications and are widely used in the chemical industry, drying or coating processes. The catalysts are very tolerant to silicon, which makes them the preferred choice for applications using organic bound silicon like anti-foaming agents.

## Applications

Most common solvents, silicon tolerant
