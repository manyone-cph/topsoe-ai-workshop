# CATALYSTS

Replacing TK-431, TK-441 SiliconTrap™is a high surface area catalyst for desulfurization of coker naphthas containing up to 11 ppm silicon. The metal loading of TK-441 SiliconTrap™ gives this catalyst a high hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and a high hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) activity. The pure alumina carrier used for preparation of TK-441 SiliconTrap™ ensures that this catalyst has a very high density and a higher surface area compared with other commercially available coker naphtha catalysts. As a result, TK-441 SiliconTrap™ has a very high surface area per reactor volume, which results in a very high silicon pick-up capacity and, thus, a prolonged cycle length.

TK-441 SiliconTrap™ is also the recommended catalyst for diolefin saturation. Diolefin hydrotreating is best carried out in a separate guard reactor operating at low operating temperature (180–220°C).
