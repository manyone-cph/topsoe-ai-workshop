# CATALYSTS

TK-339 is developed for fixed-bed hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) service. The catalyst is typically applied as top grading in diesel hydrotreating units, processing mixtures of diesel and renewable fuels. TK-339 is characterized by high HDO activity and, at the same time, relatively low activities of hydrodesulfurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and saturation.
