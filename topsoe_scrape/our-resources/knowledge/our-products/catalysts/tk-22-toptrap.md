# CATALYSTS

## Particulate trap

TK-22 TopTrap™ is an inert, reticulated, macro-porous material designed to pick up particulates, scales, and other contaminants. The combination of the very high-effective, internal porosity and the external void space creates more than 90% effective void space. The TK-22 TopTrap™ has a pore size of 30 pores per inch (PPI) and should be loaded in combination with other TopTrap™ products.

## Application

Macro-porous inert for trapping particulates in hydrocarbon feedstocks. Integral part of the grading system.
