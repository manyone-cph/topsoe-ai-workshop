# CATALYSTS

TK-931 is part of TOPSOE™’s hydrocracking red series developed for maximum hydrogenation. It is a low zeolitic NiW catalyst with high selectivity for middle distillates. TK-931 provides excellent middle distillate yield with low overcracking. Furthermore, TK-931 enhances the quality of the products (high viscosity index of unconverted oil, high smoke point of kerosene, high cetane number of diesel).

## Application

- Hydrocracking
