# CATALYSTS

TK-719 is a high-porosity demetallization catalyst for fixed-bed resid service. It is applied in the front-end of resid hydrotreaters due to its enhanced ability to remove metals and asphaltenes and to reduce Conradson carbon residue (CCR). Even though large particles usually result in lower hydrodemetallization (HDM)Â activity and a low metal storage capacity, the unique pore system of TK-719 enables this catalyst to maintain a high HDM activity and provide capacity for metal storage.
