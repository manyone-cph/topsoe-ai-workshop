# CATALYSTS

A patent-pending solution for phosphorus control and low-hydrogenation activity. The TK-3000 PhosTrap™ proprietary design minimizes carbon buildup along the catalyst layer, and offers far greater phosphorus absorption than any traditional catalyst. The result is significant protection against pressure-drop buildup and activity loss, ensuring optimal cycle length.
