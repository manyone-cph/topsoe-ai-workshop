# CATALYSTS

## Ammonia synthesis catalyst

KM1R is a pre-reduced iron-based ammonia synthesis catalyst containing a number of carefully selected promoters.

## Application

KM1R is used in the majority of the worldâ€™s ammonia converters to convert synthesis gas containing hydrogen and nitrogen into ammonia.

## Pre-reduced for faster activation

KM1R is a pre-reduced ammonia synthesis catalyst produced through carefully controlled reduction of[KM1](/products/catalysts/km1)and skin passivated to ensure safe handling. The use of KM1R significantly reduces the time required for catalyst activation, thereby minimizing plant downtime. Furthermore, the activation of KM1R only generates minor amounts of water, resulting in less aqueous ammonia produced during start-up.
