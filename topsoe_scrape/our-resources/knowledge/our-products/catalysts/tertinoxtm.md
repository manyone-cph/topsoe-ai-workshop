## Raise the bar on N2O abatement with TertiNOx™

Reducing N2O emissions from nitric acid units is a cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. TOPSOE™’s tertiary process raises the bar even higher by using TertiNOx™ catalysts to help companies save while reducing N2O by as much as 99%.

In addition, TertiNOx™ is highly active for NOxremoval and will ensure compliance with NOxregulations while removing N2O.When deployed in the tail gas, the TertiNOx™ will help you realize significant savings from the CO2market. At the same time, your operations will benefit from:

- Low pressure drop
- Combined N2O and NOx removal
- Higher production throughput
- Increased steam production
- Higher expander duty

It’s also good to know that unlike catalyst pellets, you can install TOPSOE™’s monolith in your current reactor, or deploy a smaller, simpler reactor design.
