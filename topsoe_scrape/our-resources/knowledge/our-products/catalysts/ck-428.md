# CATALYSTS

CK-428 consists of copper and manganese oxides on a silica carrier and is promoted with platinum. It is tailor-made for the catalytic combustion of sulfur compounds in off-gasses of for instance roasters or smelters and the catalytic combustion of ammonia with a high selectivity towards nitrogen (N2).

## Applications

Sulfur compounds, ammonia
