# CATALYSTS

## Ammonia synthesis catalyst

KMR 111 is a pre-reduced iron-based ammonia synthesis catalyst optimized for performance in the lower bed(s) of the converter.

## Application

KM 111 is optimized to perform in the lower bed(s) where the concentration of ammonia is higher.

## Pre-reduced for faster activation

KMR 111 is a pre-reduced ammonia synthesis catalyst produced through carefully controlled reduction of KM 111 and skin passivated to ensure safe handling. The use of KMR 111 significantly reduces the time required for catalyst activation, thereby minimizing plant downtime. Furthermore, the activation of KMR 111 only generates minor amounts of water, resulting in less aqueous ammonia produced during start-up.
