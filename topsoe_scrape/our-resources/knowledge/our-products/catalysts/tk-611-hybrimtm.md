# CATALYSTS

TK-611 HyBRIM™ is the latest generation, high-activity NiMo catalyst based on the novel HyBRIM™ technology. TK-611 HyBRIM™ is outstanding for use as a first-stage catalyst in hydrocracking units, where maximum HDN of straight-run and cracked fractions in the VGO range is essential.

Furthermore, TK-611 HyBRIM™ is the superior choice for high-severity ULSD hydrotreating units operating at medium to high pressure. TK-611 HyBRIM™ is suitable for a broad range of straight-run and cracked distillate stocks.

TK-611 HyBRIM™ is especially suitable for aromatic saturation in high-pressure units. Aromatic saturation is essential when cetane improvement, low aromatic content or high volume swell is desired.

## Application

- Hydrocracker pretreat
- Production of ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD)

This article shows how Topsoe's research  has played a key role in enhancing the performance of hydrocracking in refining industry.
