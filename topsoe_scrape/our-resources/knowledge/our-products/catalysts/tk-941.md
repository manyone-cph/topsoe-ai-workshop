# CATALYSTS

TK-941 is part of TOPSOE™’s hydrocracking red series developed for maximum hydrogenation. TK-941 has a high selectivity to middle distillates, and it can be used in applications where high cracking activity and high middle distillate yield are required, and where high light-ends yield is undesirable.

## Application

- Hydrocracking
- Shale oil processing
- Spent lube processing
