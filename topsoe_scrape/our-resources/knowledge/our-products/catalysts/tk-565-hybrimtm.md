# CATALYSTS

TK-565 HyBRIM™ belongs to the new generation of extremely high-active catalysts based on the novel HyBRIM™ technology. With a very attractive fill cost, it provides high hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity, along with aromatic saturation and conversion into lighter products. The enhanced aromatic saturation improves the product density and yields a high volume swell for the liquid product. The HyBRIM™ technology process ensures high catalyst stability when processing both straight-run and cracked distillate fractions.

With optimal utilization of the active metals, TK-565 HyBRIM™ is developed to yield a high desulfurization and denitrogenation volume activity when applied in medium to high pressure mild hydrocrackers, FCC pretreaters and diesel applications.

## Application

- FCC pretreatment
- Mild hydrocracking
- Diesel hydrotreating
- Lube polishing
