# CATALYSTS

TK-943 is part of TOPSOE™’s hydrocracking blue series developed for maximum cold ﬂow properties of diesel. TK-943 is a medium- to high-activity hydrocracking catalyst with excellent selectivity to diesel. It is optimized for maximum production of middle distillate products with good cold flow properties, and it is also very suitable for low conversion applications, where high stability and excellent cold flow properties of the products are required.

## Application

- Hydrocracking
- Diesel hydrotreating
- Spent lube processing
