# CATALYSTS

## High void topping material

TK-20 is an inert material and is shape-optimized for high porosity and high bed void fraction. It traps and distributes impurities over a large volume of material and prolongs the lifetime of downstream shift catalysts.

## Application

Catalyst grading systems
