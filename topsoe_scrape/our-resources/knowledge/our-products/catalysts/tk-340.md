# CATALYSTS

With the same high selectivity as the TK-330, but even greater activity, the TK-340 is typically applied in bulk for renewable diesel hydrotreating and sustainable aviation fuel production. It is ideal for maximizing middle-distillate yields of renewable fuels. Minimal CO and CO2are produced as a consequence. In addition, the catalyst exhibits high HDO activity and very high double-bond saturation levels.
