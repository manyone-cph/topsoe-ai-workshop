# CATALYSTS

TK-337 is developed for fixed-bed hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) service. This catalyst is typically applied as top grading in diesel hydrotreating units, processing mixtures of diesel and renewable fuels. TK-337 is characterized by high hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) activity and, at the same time, moderate activities of hydrodesulfurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and saturation.
