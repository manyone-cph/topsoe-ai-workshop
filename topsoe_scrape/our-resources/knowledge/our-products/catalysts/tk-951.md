# CATALYSTS

TK-951 is part of TOPSOE™’s hydrocracking red series developed for maximum hydrogenation. TK-951 is a high-activity hydrocracking catalyst, providing optimum diesel and naphtha yields, while minimizing overcracking. It has a strong hydrogenation function that improves the properties of the different product fractions.

## Application

- Hydrocracking
- Diesel hydrotreating
- Shale oil processing
