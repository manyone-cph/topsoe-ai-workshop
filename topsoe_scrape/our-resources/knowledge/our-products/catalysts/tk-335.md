# CATALYSTS

TK-335 is developed for fixed-bed HDO service. ThisÂ catalyst is typically applied as top grading in diesel hydrotreating units, processing phosphorus-containing renewable fuels. TK-335 is characterized by high hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) activity and, at the same time, relatively low activities of hydrodesulfurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and saturation.
