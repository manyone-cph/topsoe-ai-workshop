# CATALYSTS

## High temperature shift catalyst

SK-201-2 is a copper promoted iron/chromium based high temperature shift catalyst with ultra-low hexavalent chromium levels.

## Application

SK-201-2 is used for conversion of carbon monoxide in various applications, but is most widely installed in hydrogen and ammonia plants.

## Easy operation

Due to careful selection of raw materials and meticulous production, the content of impurities like sulfur and chlorine in the final product is very low. This together with the ultra-low levels of hexavalent chromium eliminates the need of a special activation procedure. Activation of the catalyst is simply carried out in conjunction with start-up of the reforming section and will only take few hours.
