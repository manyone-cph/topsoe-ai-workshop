# CATALYSTS

## Medium temperature shift catalyst

TOPSOE™’s medium temperature shift catalysts[LK-813](/products/catalysts/lk-813)and[LK-819](/products/catalysts/lk-819)are used for the conversion of carbon monoxide at temperatures ranging from 190 to 330ºC.

## Application

TOPSOE™’s MTS catalysts have specifically been developed to cover a wide range of operating conditions: TOPSOE™ MTS catalysts may be used as a replacement for the standard high-temperature shift catalyst in ammonia and hydrogen plants operating at low steam to carbon ratios. In ammonia plants, the MTS catalyst will typically be followed by a low-temperature shift catalyst where the CO content is further reduced.In new hydrogen plants, the MTS catalysts may replace both the high and low-temperature shift catalysts in which case the MTS exit gas is directly sent to a PSA unit.

## Catalyst loading scheme and characteristics

The standard MTS loading is a triple-decker/”sandwich” loading:

The top layer of[LSK-2](/products/catalysts/lsk-2)protects the middle layer of[LK-813](/products/catalysts/lk-813)from chlorine poisoning apart from having the advantage of being resistant against water droplets.

- At the low temperatures in the top of the bed, the[LK-813](/products/catalysts/lk-813)has a higher activity than[LK-819](/products/catalysts/lk-819)
- It has a higher sulfur capacity than[LK-819](/products/catalysts/lk-819)and thus gives a better protection in case sulfur should enter the system

In the hot bottom part, the more thermo-stable[LK-819](/products/catalysts/lk-819)is installed.
