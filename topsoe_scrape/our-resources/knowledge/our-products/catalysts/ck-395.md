# CATALYSTS

## Exceptional halogen tolerance - excellent oxidation performance

The new CK-395 combines the best of two worlds: high tolerance towards halogens (chlorine, bromide, fluorine) embodied as an efficient oxidation catalyst for VOC abatement.

## Applications

The TOPSOEâ„¢ CK-395 catalyst is a newly developed improvement of the well proven[CK-305](/products/catalysts/ck-305)and[CK-306](/products/catalysts/ck-306)catalysts. It is specifically designed to operate in environments with high concentrations of halogens, such as pharmaceutical, chemical, or waste water treatment processes.

## Easy handling

The former[CK-305](/products/catalysts/ck-305)and[CK-306](/products/catalysts/ck-306)catalysts both contained chromium oxides, and special precautions thus had to be taken when loading. Now, handling is simple with the CK-395 catalyst as it only consists of fairly harmless manganese oxides and alumina.

## Performance

The CK-395 is a base-metal oxide catalyst with an excellent catalyst performance.

## Wide temperature window

Due to the special preparation technique, the CK-395 catalyst is able to operate in a wide temperature range without losing its performance.
