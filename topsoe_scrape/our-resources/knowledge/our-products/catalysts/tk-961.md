# CATALYSTS

TK-961 is part of TOPSOE™’s hydrocracking red series developed for maximum hydrogenation. TK-961 is a zeolitic NiW based hydrocracking catalyst with very high activity and a very high nitrogen tolerance. TK-961 provides balanced naphtha and middle distillate yields, minimizing overcracking, and is our recommended catalyst for flexible operations. TK-961 has a strong hydrogenation function that improves the desired properties of the different product fractions.

## Application

- Hydrocracking
- Shale oil processing
