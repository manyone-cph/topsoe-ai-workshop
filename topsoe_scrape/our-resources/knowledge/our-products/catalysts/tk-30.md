TK-30 is a high purity alumina catalyst shaped as rings or extrudates. As a separate layer, it functions as void grading material in catalytic reactors, but it can also be used as diluent for controlling catalyst activity in any hydroprocessing application.

## Application

Catalyst grading systems.
