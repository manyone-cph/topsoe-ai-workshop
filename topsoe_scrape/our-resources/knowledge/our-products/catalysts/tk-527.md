# CATALYSTS

The latest sulfur specifications for gasoline being implemented in Europe and North America increase the significance of naphtha hydrotreating units and in particular their performance. TOPSOE™ developed a high-active naphtha catalyst designated TK-527. Larger pores and physically smaller catalyst particles result in a higher catalyst activity, since naphtha hydrotreating is most often limited by pore diffusion.
