# CATALYSTS

## Methanol synthesis catalyst

MK-121 methanol synthesis catalyst is developed to match the requirements of methanol producers today in an increasingly competitive market place. Based on an optimized copper dispersion, MK-121 ensures a high preservation of the initial high catalyst activity as well as an improved stability.

## Applications

MK-121 offers a high ﬂexibility in the operation allowing it to be used at a wide range of feed gasses, including gasses from:

- Coal gasification
- Reforming of natural gas or coke-oven gas

MK-121 guarantees high conversion and carbon efﬁciency during a prolonged service life. Lower by-product level in the crude methanol is achieved by meticulous catalyst design and production.

## Technical specs

- Size (mm): Ø6 x 4
- Typical loading density (kg/m3): 1200–1300
