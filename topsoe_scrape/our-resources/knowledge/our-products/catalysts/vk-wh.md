# CATALYSTS

VK-WH is a cesium-promoted catalyst designed for continuous operation down to 370°C/700°F in medium- to high-strength SO2+SO3gasses. A top-layer of VK-WH can significantly improve operating flexibility by widening the bed temperature control window, especially in plants struggling with fluctuating gas conditions. For WSA-DC plants operating with high-strength feed gas, VK-WH offers the ability to operate the first bed with more control and without excessive outlet temperatures while maintaining excellent bed conversion.

Improved energy efficiency throughout the operating cycle due to low initial pressure drop.
