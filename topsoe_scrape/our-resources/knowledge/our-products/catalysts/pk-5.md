# CATALYSTS

## Methanation catalyst

PK-5 is a ring-shaped methanation catalyst for conversion of carbon oxides to methane.

## Application

PK-5 is used for conversion of carbon oxides to methane in ammonia plants. PK-5 is sometimes installed on top of the prereducedÂ catalyst[PK-7R](/products/catalysts/pk-7r).

## Reduced operating expenses

Compared to conventional sphere- or cylindrical-shaped methanation catalysts, the ring-shaped PK-5 enables 30-70% lower pressure drop. This leads to very significant savings over the years, as less compression energy is required when operating with PK-5.

## Proven performance for decades

On-spec synthesis gas is the key to reliable performance in many chemical plants, and with PK-5 you will get maximum conversion of CO and CO2with lifetimes often exceeding 20 years.
