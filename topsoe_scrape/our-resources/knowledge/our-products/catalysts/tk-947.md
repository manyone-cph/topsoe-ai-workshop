TK-947 is part of TOPSOE™’s hydrocracking red series developed for maximum hydrogenation. TK-947 is recommended for applications where high cracking activity and high middle distillate yield are required. Also, it is an excellent choice for mild hydrocracking (MHC) applications, where high product quality is required at moderate pressure and medium conversion.
