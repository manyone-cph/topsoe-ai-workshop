# CATALYSTS

TK-747 HyOctane™ is a catalyst with a high nickel content, specifically developed for Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) gasoline post-treatment, ensuring minimum octane loss and reduction of mercaptans in the product. TK-747 HyOctane™ is suitable for the mercaptan polishing reactor down-stream the HDS reactor(s) in the FCC gasoline post-treatment unit.

TK-747 HyOctane™ is part of TOPSOE™’s series of HyOctane catalysts that are specifically developed for all steps in FCC gasoline post-treatment applications.

Other catalysts in this series are[TK-703 HyOctane™](https://www.topsoe.com/products/catalysts/tk-703-hyoctanetm?hsLang=en)and[TK-710 HyOctane™](https://www.topsoe.com/products/catalysts/tk-710-hyoctanetm?hsLang=en).

Their optimized activity and selectivity enable removal of sulfur to ultra-low levels while retaining high octane numbers, allowing a stable, flexible, and profitable production of high-quality gasoline.

## Application

It is applied in Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) gasoline post-treatment.
