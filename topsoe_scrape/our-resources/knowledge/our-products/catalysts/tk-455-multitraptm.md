# CATALYSTS

## Hydroprocessing catalyst

TK-455 MultiTrap™ is a large pore, high-porosity catalyst for trapping silicon and phosphorus in gasoil and vacuum gas oil (VGO) feeds. TK-455 MultiTrap™ is applied in the top bed of hydrotreaters as part of the catalyst grading system. The unique pore system enables this catalyst to also pick up metals (Ni, V and Fe) and provide high capacity for metal storage.

## Application areas

Removal of silicon and phosphorus in hydrocarbon streams, catalyst bed grading.
