# CATALYSTS

## Alkali promoted tubular reforming catalyst

Low alkali pre-reduced catalyst for steam reforming.

## Application

RK-211 is used in tubular reformers for steam reforming of feedstocks ranging from natural gas to LPG. RK-211 is pre-reduced version and installed on top of[RK-201](/products/catalysts/rk-201)and a non-alkali catalyst like[R-67-7H](/products/catalysts/r-67-7h).

## Heavy Natural Gas and LPG

The low alkali catalysts RK-211 and[RK-201](/products/catalysts/rk-201)contain approximately half a percent potassium oxide and are suitable for processing heavy natural gas and LPG, whereas the high alkali catalysts, with more than one percent potassium oxide are capable of handling naphtha feedstocks.

RK-211 is delivered pre-reduced and in addition to potassium, are also promoted with a noble metal. This feature of the catalyst makes it especially suited for the inlet conditions in a steam reforming furnace, where low temperatures are prevailing. The superior ability of RK-211 to operate at the low temperatures in the top of the catalyst tube is the result of a special manufacturing technique and the addition of a noble metal promoter. An additional advantage is that the catalysts have been reduced in TOPSOE™’s production facilities in dry hydrogen at an optimal temperature, which results in higher activity than what could be obtained by in-situ reduction.
