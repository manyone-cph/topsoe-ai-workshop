# CATALYSTS

## TopFrax™ catalytic ceramic filter

TopFrax™ is a patent-pending catalyst-coated ceramic filter designed to treat off-gasses in high-dust environments found in a wide range of industries and activities.

## How TopFrax™ works

The TopFrax™ filter is based on a ceramic fiber impregnated with a particular catalytic solution. The chemical composition is made to suit the specific needs of the different customers.  A combination of dust, NOX, NH3, dioxins, CO and different VOCs can be removed in one single step. The catalyst is loaded uniformly along a well-defined fraction of the wall providing the lowest cost of compliance and ensuring undesirable reactions (e.g. SO2oxidation).In addition to their multi-compound capabilities, TopFrax™ ceramic catalytic filters are effective at temperatures as high as 400°C. Combined, these advantages can help you reduce capital expenditures by up to 40% compared to competing solutions.

## Broad spectrum of regulated pollutants

Built on decades of leadership in filtration and catalysis, TopFrax™ can transform the economics of meeting regulatory emissions standards, removing dust and multiple gaseous compounds in one single step.

## Dust

TopFrax™ effectively blocks particulates and dust particles at the filter surface the same way conventional filters do, ensuring full compliance with stringent emission standards.TopFrax™ candles are made from either refractory ceramics or fibers with low bio-persistence. Both products trap dust emissions (below PM 2.5) down to 2 mg/Nm3.

## NOx

TopFrax™ use selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to remove NOx from off-gas, by utilizing ammonia to convert to harmless nitrogen and water.

## VOCs

The catalyst sites on TopFrax™ filters also oxidize CO and volatile organic compounds into harmless CO2and H2O.The TopFrax™ oxidation version ensures optimal combustion of VOCs with no additional emission of CO.

## Dioxins

TopFrax™ also ensures compliance with limits on dioxins and furans, by treating more than 99% of these by converting them into harmless compounds and reducing their concentrations to below 0.1 ng/Nm3, TEQ.

## Reduce technology costs by up to 40%

As the only catalytic ceramic filter of its kind, TopFrax™ delivers entirely unique cost-saving benefits – saving up to 40% compared to separate DeNOx and oxidation technologies.Other benefits include:

- Simultaneous dust and multiple gaseous compounds removal in a single step
- No need for costly, space-demanding tail-end gas removal equipment
- Catalytic ceramic filter accommodates temperatures as high as 400°C (752°F)
- No contact between catalyst and potentially harmful particles
- Exceptional resistance to catalyst poisoning
- Effective down to 180°C (356°F) operation
- Easy to install and handle
