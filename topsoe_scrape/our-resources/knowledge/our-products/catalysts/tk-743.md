# CATALYSTS

TK-743 is a demetallization catalyst with moderate hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity for fixed-bed resid service and vacuum gas oil (VGO) hydrotreating. It is typically used for reduction of metals, asphaltenes and Conradson Carbon Residue (CCR) as a first-stage catalyst in composite catalyst fillings. The optimized pore system and high pore volume allow enhanced metal pick-up while maintaining activity.
