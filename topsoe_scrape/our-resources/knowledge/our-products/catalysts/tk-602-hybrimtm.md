# CATALYSTS

TK-602 HyBRIM™ belongs to the new generation of extremely high-active catalysts based on the novel HyBRIM™ technology. With its unique combination of cobalt, nickel and molybdenum, the catalyst provides high hydrodenitrogenation and hydrodesulfurization activity, along with controlled aromatic saturation, and low hydrogen consumption.  The HyBRIM™ technology process ensures high catalyst stability when processing both straight-run and cracked distillate fractions. With optimal utilization of the active metals, TK-602 HyBRIM™ is made to yield a high desulfurization and denitrogenation volume activity when applied in medium pressure diesel applications.

## Application
