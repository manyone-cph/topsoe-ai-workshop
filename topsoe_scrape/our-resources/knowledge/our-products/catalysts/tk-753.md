# CATALYSTS

TK-753 is a transition catalyst in fixed-bed resid hydrodesulfurization (HDS) systems. In such applications, it would be preceded by a hydrodemetallization (HDM) type catalyst and followed by a HDS-type catalyst (like[TK-773](/products/catalysts/tk-773)). TK-753 exhibits good HDS activity and HDM selectivity. The pore size distribution and pore volume have been optimized, resulting in a high capacity for uptake of nickel and vanadium and a low bulk density.
