# CATALYSTS

## Low temperature shift catalyst

LK-801 is TOPSOE™’s first generation LTS catalyst. Similar to our other LTS catalysts, it is based on oxides of copper, zinc, and aluminum.

## Application

LK-801 is used in ammonia and hydrogen plants for the conversion of carbon monoxide via the water-gas shift reaction.

## Competitive performance

The activity of LK-801, though not as high as that of TOPSOE™’s standard and premium LTS catalysts, has demonstrated its ability to optimize plant performance for decades at numerous plants worldwide.

## High mechanical strength

LK-801 and its successors ([LK-821-2](/products/catalysts/lk-821-2),[LK-823](/products/catalysts/lk-823)and[LK-853 FENCE™](/products/catalysts/lk-853-fencetm)) are manufactured to ensure the highest possible crush strength, resulting in a low and stable pressure drop throughout the catalyst lifetime.
