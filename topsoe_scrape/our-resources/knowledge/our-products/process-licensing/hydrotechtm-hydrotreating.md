# PROCESS LICENSING

## Optimized to your operations

Today, operational efficiency and the production of robust yields of cleaner fuels from difficult-to-process feedstocks are essential to plant profitability.

TOPSOE™’s HydroTech™ hydrotreating processes can help you achieve these goals and meet the growing demand for high quality products. Thanks to our innovative technologies and comprehensive portfolio of catalysts, we can match the best catalysts with HydroTech™, our innovative hydroprocessing technologies, to ensure you meet your business objectives.

You can leverage our expertise in hydroprocessing to help you design hydrotreating units tailored to the type of feedstock you use and your product and capacity targets. Combined with our top-performing catalysts we will help you optimize investment and operating costs as well as energy consumption.

TOPSOE™ HydroTech™. The power to deliver:

- Hydrotreating of oil fractions from naphtha to resid
- Hydrocracking of heavy oil fractions
- Atmospheric Residue De-Sulfurization (ARDS)
- Ultra-low sulfur diesel production
- Diesel dewaxing
- Aromatics saturation
- TOPSOE™’s Aroshift process
- Color control
- Renewable feed hydroprocessing — co-processing or stand-alone — for gasoline, jet fuel and diesel production

TOPSOE™ provides licensed HydroTech™ hydrotreating process designs for deep desulfurization of straight run or cracked distillates, pretreatment of FCC and hydrocracker feed stocks.

Our hydrotreating process reduces organic sulfur and nitrogen components to low levels. In deep desulphurization units, for example, it will help you meet the maximum 5 – 10 wppm sulfur specification levels for diesel oil and limit the content of poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds to meet the 8 wt% PAH targets.

TOPSOE™ engineers will work hard to help you get the most out of your hydroprocessing technology, including design of grassroot hydroprocessing units or revamping existing units. Our suite of products and services includes engineering, catalysts, reactor internals, and optimization services.

**The layout of a typical unit**There is no one solution for all refineries. Your technology configuration will, of course, depend on the feed, product specifications, unit pressure, make-up gas purity and more. The figure below shows a typical HydroTech™ hydrotreating layout, with a hot separator and a cold separator.

The gas oil feed is pressurized and mixed with hydrogen-rich treat gas. The stream is then heated and fed to the reactor, where organic sulfur and nitrogen compounds are converted to H2S and NH3. Aromatic compounds are saturated by exothermic reaction with hydrogen.

Effluent from the reactor is cooled before entering the hot separator where gas and liquid are separated. The gas is cooled before it enters the cold separator. In the cold separator the recycle gas is separated from gas oil and is sent to amine absorber for removal of H2S. The H2S-free gas is compressed by the recycle gas compressor and mixed with make-up gas, then added to the feed.The hydrocarbon products from the hot and cold separators are sent to the fractionation section where light ends and hydrocarbon products are separated.
