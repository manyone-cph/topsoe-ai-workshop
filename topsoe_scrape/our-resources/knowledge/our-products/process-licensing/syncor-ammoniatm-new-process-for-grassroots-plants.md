# PROCESS LICENSING

By rewriting the book on ammonia plant capacities, SynCOR Ammonia™ enables greater economies of scale and paves the way for new benchmarks, new financials and new opportunities – all using proven technologies.

SynCOR Ammonia™ is a technology break-through in the ammonia industry. Where all ammonia plants today rely on conventional two-step reforming based on tubular steam methane reforming and an air-fired secondary reformer, SynCOR Ammonia™ utilizes[the unique TOPSOE™ SynCOR™ solution, a process based on oxygen-fired](/products/equipment/syncortm-autothermal-reformer-atr)[autothermal](/products/equipment/syncortm-autothermal-reformer-atr)[reforming](/products/equipment/syncortm-autothermal-reformer-atr).

SynCOR Ammonia™ introduces a previously unseen scaling factor for single-train ammonia plants, thanks to a steam-to-carbon ratio of just 0.6 – reducing steam throughput by 80%. The result can be double-digit reductions in the cost per ton of producing ammonia – with greater savings achieved the further you scale up.

By introducing new economies of scale into ammonia production, SynCOR Ammonia™ gives plant owners breakthrough options for profitable expansion and provides new investors with an opportunity to enter the market with a sharp competitive edge.

Complete portfolio of catalysts for ammonia production.

Until now, large-scale ammonia production in single line configuration has suffered from a lack of demonstrated plant concepts with proven feasibility and competitiveness and traditionally, the industry has perceived 3,500 MTPD as the limit in single line capacity.

As the world transitions towards a sustainable  and carbon-neutral future, the need for clean  energy sources has become increasingly urgent.  Up until now, oil and fossil fuels are the dominant  feedstock for global scale energy export, import  and storage. However, the industrial transition,  driven by the global ambitions to limit greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions, and the continuous reduction  of renewable electricity costs, are changing the  landscape.
