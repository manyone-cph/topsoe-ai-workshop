## Regenerate spent acid with minimal energy costs

SmartSAR™ is a cost-effective and well-proven spent acid regeneration (SAR) technology that produces no waste and is highly energy efficient.

**On-site regeneration**Refiners today face a common challenge to increase yields and octane numbers while keeping costs down. To accomplish this, sulfuric acid-catalyzed alkylation is often used. These types of alkylation units produce spent sulfuric acid that must be regenerated. The conventional SAR units used in the regeneration process require scrubbing, washing, and drying processes to take dust and impurities out of the gas after incineration of the spent acid. These processes can be costly and time-consuming for refiners.

SmartSAR™ takes the SAR process one step further by allowing refiners to regenerate spent acid without using scrubbing and drying processes. This is done using a hot gas candle filter or an electrostatic precipitator, which takes out dust and impurities without cooling down the gas, avoiding acid and energy waste.Protect your profit with a compact solution that allows you to regenerate sulfuric acid and improve OPEX, lose less equipment, and attain high availability.

**The SmartSAR™ process**

****

**How it works**SmartSAR™ regenerates spent acid without using scrubbing and drying processes. Here’s how it works:

- The SmartSAR™ process starts with incineration of spent sulfuric acid, followed by a waste heat boiler for heat recovery.
- A hot gas filter or an electrostatic precipitator removes dust and impurities from the gas.
- SO2is converted to SO3in the two- or three-bed SO2converter.
- The SO3combines with water vapor in the gas to form sulfuric vapor that is condensed and concentrated to 98.5% strength in the WSA condenser. The sulfuric acid can then be returned directly to the alkylation unit.This SmartSAR™ technology can also be applied for regeneration of spent sulfuric acid from processes other than alkylation.
