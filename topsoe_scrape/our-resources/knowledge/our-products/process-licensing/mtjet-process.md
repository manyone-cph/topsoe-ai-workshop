# PROCESS LICENSING

**Increase economy of scale and capitalize on a flexible methanol to jet fuel solution**

With sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) taking off, producers need a robust pathway that can help future-proof their business while simultaneously generating operational stability around the clock. The MTJet™ solution offers just that. Utilizing methanol as an intermediate for jet fuel synthesis allows producers to handle and capitalize on a dynamic range of situations and feedstocks.

**The****MTJet™ process pathway**

Our MTJet™****technology is based on years of commercial experience and internal research and development within methanol synthesis and methane-rich gas-to-gasoline processes – TIGAS™. The result is a methanol-to-jet solution that can deliver eJet fuel from renewable electricity, water, and CO2or advanced biofuel from solid biomass feedstocks. Creating a truly end-to-end– feedstock to jet fuel out product.

**MTJet™ - Dynamic operation. Stable production.**

High-capacity utilization on the backend is attributed to TOPSOE™’s methanol synthesis process, which can operate at 10% of its design capacity and handle temporary electrolyzer shutdown. Allowing operations to run directly off methanol storage tanks.

Furthermore, this backend can be scaled to even higher capacities when imported green methanol is introduced into the equation. This flexibility provides SAF producers with a diverse range of options, negating any issues surrounding upstream feedstock fluctuations and challenges or facility limitations. Thereby achieving increased economy of scale for your operation and further reducing CAPEX.

**Single-point benefits**

- Extensive experience within methanol and gasoline synthesis.
- Proven track record of integrated technologies within large, commercialized plants.
- A licensing process backed by IP, patents, and proprietary technology and catalysts.
- Reliable technology and service representatives.
