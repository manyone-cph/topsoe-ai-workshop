# PROCESS LICENSING

## One solution – unlimited flexibility

TOPSOE™’s FCC pretreatment technology has the flexibility to treat a wide spectrum of feedstocks – from gas oils, heavy-vacuum gas oils, and coker streams to residuals.

Based on your specific needs, TOPSOE™’s FCC pretreatment technology can be tailored to optimize your refining capabilities. No matter what your objectives – be it deep desulfurization to meet gasoline-sulfur specifications or denitrogenation and metals removal to maximize FCC catalyst activity without suffering loss in octane – our advanced technology is ready to handle the challenge. It can even tackle Conradson carbon reduction and the saturation of polyaromatics to maximize gasoline yields.

TOPSOE™ has extensive experience with revamping moderate to low-pressure units for deep desulfurization. This solution will enable your plant to directly blend gasoline produced from the FCC while meeting low-sulfur (less than 15 ppm) gasoline specifications.

Another option is TOPSOE™’s Aroshift™. This process maximizes the conversion of polyaromatics, which can be equilibrium-limited at high operating temperatures. The Aroshift™ process increases FCC conversion, gasoline yield, and C3/C4 olefins while reducing the amount of light and heavy cycle oil.

**Get the best out of your unit**Getting the best out of a FCC pretreatment unit requires a deep understanding of your process objectives and understanding of the hardware, catalysts, and processes involved. This is why TOPSOE™ promises to take a deep dive into your operations before we tailor a solution that will help you achieve your business goals.
