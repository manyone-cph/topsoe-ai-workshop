# PROCESS LICENSING

## From by-product to profitable product

Coke oven tar is a big headache for many refineries. It is a low-value by-product that is difficult and expensive to dispose of in a responsible way.

**The cure**TOPSOE™’s antidote to coal tar headaches is a processing technology that enables refineries to process tar from ovens and gasifiers and turn it into valuable products, like low-sulfur diesel, naphtha, or lubricating oils.

Being able to handle wide variations in tar properties, the entire process takes place right on site and processes tar into high-quality products for commercial sale.

**An innovative alternative**As feedstocks continue to get heavier, TOPSOE™’s solutions give refiners a proven, fully integrated solution for turning coal tar and squeezing more value from their operations.
