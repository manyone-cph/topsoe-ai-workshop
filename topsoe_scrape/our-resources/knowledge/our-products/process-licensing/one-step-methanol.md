# PROCESS LICENSING

## Low cost technology for small to medium capacity

This technology uses only steam reforming as synthesis gas generator. Operating cost is higher than for than for technologies involving Oxygen reforming but capital cost is low. The optimal capacity range is from 500 up to 2500 MTPD. This can be extended to 3000 MTPD if approximate 25% of the hydrocarbon feed is CO2.
