**FLIGHT PLAN GREEN: GET READY FOR TAKE-OFF**

****Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is an exciting new direction for the aviation industry. Discover the challenges the industry faces and why SAF can be the solution.

#### The aviation industry: turbulence ahead

**Markets**.Anincreasing populationmeansincreasing energy demand. That means something needs to give in the battle against climate change: low-carbon fuelsare needed.

**Scaling up.**The public demandfor greener more sustainable flights is climbing steadily.But according to the WEF and McKinsey & Company, in 2019,fewer than 200,000 metric tonsof SAF were produced globally — less than 0.1% of the fuel used by commercial airlines.

**Feedstock limitations.**With priority given to food production,blending limitswill constrain how much first-generation, bio-based feedstocks can be used. And,in a safety-focused industry, new fuelswill be required to meetstringentcertification standards.

**Decarbonizing flights.**Technologically speaking, thehigh energy densityrequired to carry payloads over long distances and the use of non-liquid jet fuel givedisruption to the existing supply chainfrom new energy sources will provide challenges.

**Legislation.**The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation proposed SAF blending mandate hasambitious targetsregarding minimum volume percentage of SAF in the aviation fuel supply over time. The Sustainable Skies Act in the US proposessignificant incentivesfor SAF production.

**Scale up, up, up…**

The bad news?Decarbonizing aviation will not be easy.

And the good news? The technology exists to ramp up production of SAF significantly as soon as the feedstock quantities are available.And even a*small*Topsoe renewable-fuel facility produces enough Sustainable Aviation Fuel to travel 3.5 billion passenger kilometers per year.We have the R&D and practical know-how to make low-carbon travel possible.

#### **Knowledge Special: SAF TALKSTM**

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) continues to be recognized as a crucial solution for driving down the CO2 emissions of the aviation industry. And yet, SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of the global jet fuel consumption.

To fuel knowledge sharing of what it'll take to scale-up SAF, we've composed a second season of SAF TalksTMfilmed during our second SAF Summit in Copenhagen in November 2023.

In a total of 9 bite-sized videos, frontrunners from across the SAF value chain share their latest trends and insights. And trust us! The industry is far from being at a standstill with numerous development underway...
