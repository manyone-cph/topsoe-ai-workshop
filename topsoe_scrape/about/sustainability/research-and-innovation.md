# RESEARCH &INNOVATION

## 80+ YEARS OF PIONEERING INNOVATION

Our vision and strategy build on a strong scientific foundation with more than 80 years of research and development (R&D), and a deep-rooted passion for science, technology and innovation. Our world-leading and renowned research enables us to develop the solutions needed to power a sustainable future.

We were founded on the belief that applied fundamental research is key to building and retaining a leading position globally, which is why we annually reinvest massively in our R&D. We steadily increase our number of patent families, currently counting more than 600.

Since 1950, we have contributed to more than 1,800 publications, demonstrating scientific leadership amongst industrial peers.

We stay updated on the latest research through long-term scientific partnerships with more than 40 universities and research institutes and sponsor professors and PhD students. In addition, we have hundreds of collaboration projects running around the world.
