# SUSTAINABILITY

We are determined to take a leading role in the energy transition. By providing technologies andcutting-edgesolutions for the decarbonization of fuels, we enable industries to reduce their climate impact and overcome some of their most pressing challenges. We are equally ambitious when it comes to our own business.

To adhere to our values, heritage and beliefs, it is crucial to act responsibly in all aspects of our business.We are dedicated to balancing economic, social, environmental and ethical aspects of our own operations and value chain, where we have a material impact. This includes working strategically with sustainability matters to map, reduce and mitigate negative impacts, while enabling and increasing our positive impact on environment and people.

We are proud of our culture, where we provide a safe and healthy working environment for our employees, contractors and business partners – and where we create a sense of belonging through an inclusive and diverse workplace.

Our actions are based on a foundation of good governance practices, with solid governance structures and business processes in place,to ensure that we earn and always retain the trust of our customers, owners, business partners, local communities and other stakeholders.

Materiality is the foundation for how we prioritize our work on sustainability. Our material topics enable us to define, act and report on the areas where we have significant impact on our surrounding environment and people – and where these impacts pose risks to our business or create new opportunities.
