**The right routes**

Ground control, do you copy? At Topsoe we have developed the routes that we think are the best way to reach your destination: low-carbon travel.From the cutting-edge**HydroFlex™**technology to the single-point license**G2L™ Biofuels and eFuels**, we have mapped out routes to achieving feedstock flexibility and ensuring more sustainable travel happens now.

Whatever your feedstock, a low-carbon jet fuelwith good yieldsis possible.

### **Technologies tailored to your business**

**HydroFlex™**HubSpot Call-to-Action Code[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif][](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/2115834/756ee6ad-11e8-42c4-9e4a-960ee10378ec)end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code

Get full feedstock flexibility with HydroFlex™. This market-leading technology utilizes Topsoe’s hydroprocessing expertise to enable the processing of virgin oils, waste oils and fats, solid biomass, and plastic waste / tires to produce HEFA-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel with minimal Carbon Intensity (CI) compared to traditional petroleum aviation fuel.

HydroFlex™ has a high number of running references, versatile process design, hardware, and a comprehensive range of proprietary catalysts for renewable fuel production.

**G2L™****Biofuels**HubSpot Call-to-Action Code[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif][](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/2115834/49d2eb59-79d1-4c65-9a31-1e5afa784deb)end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code

Go the synthetic- and gas-based route for Sustainable Aviation Fuel with G2L™ Biofuels. This commercially proven technology utilizes Topsoe’s hydroprocessing technologies as well as Sasol’s LTFT™ technology to produceFischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK).

We supply the core technologies and engineering, catalysts, proprietary hardware, and technical services in a single-point license and offer a feed-in / product-out guarantee.

**G2L™****eFuels**HubSpot Call-to-Action Code[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif][](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/2115834/c380e774-3a33-4963-9c80-7b7043a444dd)end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code****

Create eFuels from renewable energy via green hydrogen, and from CO2via carbon capture. By combining synthesis gas, Fischer-Tropsch and hydroprocessing technologies, the G2L™ eFuels solution efficiently produces FT-SPK/eJet and a green naphtha.

The process is built around already proven solutions, integrating newly developed technologies like our fully electrified eREACTTM. This means a viable way forward for establishing eFuels production is ready now.

The Fischer-Tropsch technology is provided by our strategic partner Sasol under a single-point-license.

A robust SAF pathway that uses methanol as an intermediate in jet fuel production, allowing producers to handle and capitalize on a range of bio feedstocks.

Our MTJet™ technology is based on years of commercial experience and internal research and development within methanol synthesis and methane-rich gas-to-gasoline processes – TIGAS™.

Using Topsoe’s methanol synthesis process, MTJetTMeFuels can operate at just 10% of its design capacity and handle temporary electrolyzer shutdown, allowing operations to run directly off methanol storage tanks. The result is a methanol-to-jet solution that can deliver eJet fuel from renewable electricity, water, and CO2– creating a truly end-to-end feedstock-to-fuel process pathway.

The process grants the flexibility to handle feedstock fluctuations while providing around-the-clock operational stability.

#### **Knowledge Special: SAF TALKSTM**

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) continues to be recognized as a crucial solution for driving down the CO2 emissions of the aviation industry. And yet, SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of the global jet fuel consumption.

To fuel knowledge sharing of what it'll take to scale-up SAF, we've composed a second season of SAF TalksTMfilmed during our second SAF Summit in Copenhagen in November 2023.

In a total of 9 bite-sized videos, frontrunners from across the SAF value chain share their latest trends and insights. And trust us! The industry is far from being at a standstill with numerous development underway...
