# PROCESS LICENSING

## State-of-the-art technology

This is the most commonly used methanol technology today. It uses a combination of tubular steam reforming and oxygen reforming as synthesis gas generator to produce a stoichiometric methanol synthesis gas. The advanced TOPSOEâ„¢ tubular reforming technology provides the lowest CAPEX and OPEX for two step solution on the market. The optimal capacity range is 1000 MTPD up to 5500 MTPD.
