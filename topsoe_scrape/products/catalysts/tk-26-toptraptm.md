# CATALYSTS

## Particulate trap

TK-26 TopTrap™ is an inert macro-porous material designed to pick up iron scale and other contaminants. TK-26 TopTrap™ is a shape-optimized multiple-lobe extrudate with three central holes providing a high external void fraction. TK-26 TopTrap™ should be loaded below our high-void topping material[TK-10](/products/catalysts/tk-10)or[TK-15](/products/catalysts/tk-15).

## Application

Macro-porous inert for trapping particulates in hydrocarbon feedstocks. Integral part of the grading system.
