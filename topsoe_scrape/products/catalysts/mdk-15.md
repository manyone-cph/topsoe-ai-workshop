## Guard catalyst for methanol decomposition

The MDK-15 guard catalyst is used as a protective top layer in small scale hydrogen plants based on methanol decomposition.

MDK-15 is designed to guard against any impurities in the methanol feed. In addition, MDK-15 has a higher resistance to droplets than the methanol decomposition catalyst, which will help minimize the negative effects of any incidents involving partial condensation.

MDK-15 is normally used in combination with the[MDK-20](/products/catalysts/mdk-20)methanol decomposition catalyst.
