# CATALYSTS

TK-773 is a final-stage catalyst for fixed-bed resid hydrodesulfurization (HDS) units. It has a high HDS, hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and Conradson Carbon Residue (CCR) removal activity and, as such, has a low hydrodemetallization (HDM) selectivity. The pore size distribution and pore volume have been optimized, resulting in a better capacity for uptake of nickel and vanadium together with a low bulk density.
