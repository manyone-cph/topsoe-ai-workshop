# CATALYSTS

## Alkali promoted tubular reforming catalyst

High alkali catalyst for steam reforming of naphtha feedstocks.

## Application

RK-202 is used in tubular reformers for steam reforming of naphtha feedstocks. RK-202 is installed below the prereduced version[RK-212](/products/catalysts/rk-212)and above a low alkali catalyst like[RK-201](/products/catalysts/rk-201).

## Naphtha Reforming

The alkali content on the RK-202 and[RK-212](/products/catalysts/rk-212)catalysts has been optimized and is generally lower than seen for other alkali-promoted catalysts on the market. Since the alkali has a negative impact on the catalyst activity, the relatively low alkali content is preferable to ensure a high activity of the catalyst. Still, the alkali content on the RK-202 and[RK-212](/products/catalysts/rk-212)catalysts is sufficiently high to ensure carbon free operation in a steam reformer. The alkali content is so low that fouling of waste heat boilers basically can be excluded.
