# CATALYSTS

## Alkali promoted tubular reforming catalyst

Low alkali pre-reduced catalyst for steam reforming.

## Application

RK-400R is used in tubular reformers for steam reforming of feedstocks ranging from natural gas to LPG. RK-400R is pre-reduced and installed on top of[RK-400](/products/catalysts/rk-400)and a non-alkali catalyst like[R-67-7H](/products/catalysts/r-67-7h).

## Latest generation of low alkali catalysts

The RK-400R catalyst is the latest generation of TOPSOE™’s low alkali catalysts and offers remarkable improvements in both catalyst activity and resistance to carbon formation compared to conventional alkali-promoted products.RK-400R is delivered pre-reduced and in addition to potassium, are also promoted with a noble metal. This feature of the catalyst makes it especially suited for the inlet conditions in a steam reforming furnace, where low temperatures are prevailing. The superior ability of RK-400R to operate at the low temperatures in the top of the catalyst tube is the result of a special manufacturing technique and the addition of a noble metal promoter. An additional advantage is that the catalysts have been reduced in TOPSOE™’s production facilities in dry hydrogen at an optimal temperature, which results in higher activity than what could be obtained by in-situ reduction.
