# CATALYSTS

TK-359 is developed for fixed-bed hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) service. The catalyst is typically applied as bulk catalyst in hydrotreating units, processing mixtures of diesel and nitrogen containing renewable fuels. TK-359 is characterized by high HDO activity and, at the same time, high activities of hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and saturation. Often TK-359 is applied in combination with dewaxing catalysts.
