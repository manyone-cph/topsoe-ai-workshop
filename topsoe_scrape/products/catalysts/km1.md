# CATALYSTS

## Ammonia synthesis catalyst

KM1 is an iron-based ammonia synthesis catalyst containing a number of carefully selected promoters.

## Application

KM1 is used in the majority of the world’s ammonia converters to convert synthesis gas containing hydrogen and nitrogen into ammonia.

## An industry benchmark

Over the years, TOPSOE™ has supplied over 1,200 charges of KM1 catalyst. The high and stable activity of KM1 has resulted in an extensive track record of very long lifetimes achieved in industrial operation and record high production rates. Typically, KM1 is only replaced in connection with plant revamps or installation of new converter internals.
