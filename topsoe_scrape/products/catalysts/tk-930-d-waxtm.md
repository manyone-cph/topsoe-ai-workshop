# CATALYSTS

TK-930 D-wax™ is an isomerization selective dewaxing catalyst, specifically designed for improvement of cold flow properties with a minimum yield loss for diesel, jet fuel, and renewables. The catalyst is promoted by base metals for good stability and high hydrogenation activity, ensuring a good HDS, HDN and HDA activity. Hence, the catalyst can be loaded in the bottom of your existing hydrotreating unit, and the volume occupied by TK-930 D-wax™ will contribute to the removal of sulfur and the saturation of aromatics for additional volume swell.
