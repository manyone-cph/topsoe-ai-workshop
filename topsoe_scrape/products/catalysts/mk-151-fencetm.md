# CATALYSTS

Methanol synthesis catalyst

In the methanol business, a high on-stream factor, as well as carbon and energy efficiency, are critical to plant profitability. Our MK-151 FENCE™ methanol synthesis catalyst delivers documented industry-leading performance and stability, resulting in production gains over the catalyst’s lifetime that will enable you to far exceed your initial target.

## High and stable production rate

High performance over the long run is essential for profitable methanol production, and the MK-151 FENCE™ is a proven performer. The FENCE™ technology gives the catalyst its unique catalytic activity and stability which results in higher methanol production rates and in significantly longer catalyst lifetimes compared with competing brands.

## Low and stable pressure drop

The mechanical strength of methanol synthesis catalysts is one of the most important factors for a reliable and efficient performance of a methanol synthesis loop. A low mechanical strength of a catalyst can lead to rapid pressure drop increases, which can result in inefficient operation of the synthesis loop and even premature catalyst replacement. Strength measurements of spent samples of MK-151 FENCE™ demonstrate that it is significantly stronger than competing brands, and with MK-151 FENCE™ you can count on a low and stable pressure drop throughout the catalyst lifetime.

## FENCE™ technology prevents copper sintering

The basic principle of the FENCE™ technology is to stabilize the finely dispersed copper nanoparticles in the catalyst by creating a separation between them of multiple oxide particles. The FENCE™ technology creates a picket fence of metal oxide crystals that prevent sintering of the copper crystals, which ensures high stability of the active sites over the catalyst lifetime.

## FAQ

**What is the range of green methanol plant capacities, that TOPSOE™ is working on?**

Our MK catalyst has been operating in plants with a wide range of capacities- the biggest one being 4000 MTPD. On the other extreme of the scale, MK catalyst will also be installed soon in small modularized plants with capacities ranging between 50-100 MTPD. So, we cover the entire range.

**What is the max CO2partial pressure MK-317 can tolerate?**

We have aged our catalyst with more than 10 bar CO2PP. Considering the expected CO2partial pressure in a CO2to methanol loop, we believe we have covered the worst case scenario.

**Why is catalyst strength a challenge for CO2rich feedstock?**

A CO2rich environment can age a conventional methanol catalyst really fast, unless it is designed to counter that. The loss of strength is a part of the aging. Furthermore, most of the green methanol plants have a different and more dynamic operating mode, which is associated with numerous load fluctuations and pressure and temperature cycles. This can also have an influence on the catalyst stability and strength.

**What is the expected lifetime of TOPSOE™’s MK catalyst?**

A average lifetime of MK catalyst is around 4-5 years. We have multiple references where the MK catalyst has successfully operated for 8+ years. It is, however, important to note that lifetime is a function of different parameters, especially the poisons in the feedstock.
