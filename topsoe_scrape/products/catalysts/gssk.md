# CATALYSTS

## Guard material for sour shift applications

GSSK is used to protect the downstream sour shift catalyst from dust and other impurities.

The guard material can be used in a separate guard reactor or as top layer in the first sour shift reactor.

Due to its high porosity and large void, GSSK will trap and distribute the dust over a relatively large volume, which will help to keep the pressure drop low and ensure a longer catalyst lifetime.

Unlike sour shift catalysts, GSSK is tolerant towards condensing conditions. If droplets of water come in contact with hot GSSK pellets, the water will evaporate, which will protect the downstream sour shift catalyst.

GSSK is normally used in combination with the[SSK-10](/products/catalysts/ssk-10)sour shift catalyst.
