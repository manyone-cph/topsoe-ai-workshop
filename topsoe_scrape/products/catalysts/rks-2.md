# CATALYSTS

## Secondary and autothermal reforming catalyst

RKS-2 is a nickel based reforming catalyst for secondary and autothermal reformers.

## Application

RKS-2 is used in the upper part of the reforming catalyst bed in secondary and autothermal reformers to reduce the effect of ruby and dust deposition.

## Minimizing the pressure drop increase

The composition, shape and size of the RKS-2 catalyst are optimized to be ideal for the upper layer in reformers which are challenged by ruby or dust deposition in the catalyst bed.
