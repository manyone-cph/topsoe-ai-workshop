# CATALYSTS

## Heat exchange reforming catalyst

R-87R HEAT-X™ is a nickel-based non-alkali pre-reduced catalyst for heat exchange steam reforming.

## Application

R-87R HEAT-X™ is used in the upper part of heat exchange reformers.

## Pre-reduced, high-activity and fast start-up

R-87R HEAT-X is pre-reduced and used as the top layer in the heat exchange reformer tubes in combination with[R-87 HEAT-X™](/products/catalysts/r-87-heat-x)or with both[RK-21 HEAT-X™](/products/catalysts/rk-21-heat-x)and[R-87 HEAT-X™](/products/catalysts/r-87-heat-x). By using R-87R HEAT-X™ in the top of the tubes, the reforming process is initiated immediately when exposed to process gas. The pre-reduced R-87R HEAT-X™ is also well suited for low inlet temperature due to a special manufacturing technique. An additional advantage of R-87R HEAT-X™ is the reduction of the catalyst at TOPSOE™’s production facilities in dry hydrogen at an optimal temperature, which results in higher activity than what could be obtained by in-situ reduction.
