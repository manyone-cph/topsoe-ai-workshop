# CATALYSTS

The TK-342’s properties make it an excellent high-selectivity bulk solution. Activity and yield are both increased during hydrotreatment of renewable fuels. It also enables the highest HDO activity within the HDO-selective series, along with moderate sulfur- and nitrogen-removal performance – and very high double-bond saturation levels.
