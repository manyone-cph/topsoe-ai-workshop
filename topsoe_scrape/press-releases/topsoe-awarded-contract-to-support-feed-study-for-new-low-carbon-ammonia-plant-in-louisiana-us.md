# Topsoe awarded contract to support FEED study for new low-carbon ammonia plant in Louisiana, US

*Published: May 1, 2024*

- Topsoe will license its SynCOR Ammonia™ technology, to CF Industries that when combined with carbon capture & storage (CCS), enables the production of industry leading low-carbon ammonia.

Topsoe,a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies,has signed a contract with CF Industries, the world’s largest producer of ammonia, for the licensing and engineering supporting a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study of a new low-carbon ammonia plant in Louisiana.

CF Industries is evaluating the project in collaboration with Mitsui & Co., Ltd., one of the leading ammonia marketers in the world. Were the project to move forward, it would produce low-carbon ammonia for use as a decarbonized energy source.

Ammonia – either in the form of low-carbon ammonia or as an e-fuel – is expected to play a critical role in the world’s journey towards net zero: It can be transported using existing infrastructure; and it has multiple end-uses, not only as a fuel or hydrogen carrier but also to help decarbonize industrial processes like steel and cement production.

**Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director, The Americas, Topsoe, said:**“We believe low-carbon ammonia helps unlock the door towards a net zero future. Our technology offers a cost-effective route to producing low carbon ammonia while also enabling carbon capture, at industrial proven scale. CF and Topsoe have a long-standing relationship spanning many decades and we are proud to extend our collaboration with this award.”

**About********SynCOR™**SynCORTMtechnology enables ammonia production as well as cost efficient carbon capture. SynCOR™ is Topsoe´s proprietary technology based on advanced autothermal reforming principles. Supported by 300 years of accumulative, safe operation, SynCOR™ is often the preferred technology for mega scale ammonia production, due to its maturity and low capital and operating costs.

SynCOR Ammonia™ is a technology break-through in the ammonia industry. Where ammonia plants today rely on conventional two-step reforming based on tubular steam methane reforming and an air-fired secondary reformer, SynCOR Ammonia™ utilizes a process based on oxygen-fired autothermal reforming.
