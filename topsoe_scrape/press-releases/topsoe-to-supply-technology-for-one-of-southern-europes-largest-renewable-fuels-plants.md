# Topsoe to supply technology for one of Southern Europe’s largest renewable fuels plants

*Published: April 16, 2024*

- Cepsa and Apical’s new plant will begin production in 2026 and is expected to produce 500,000 tons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel annually.
- Topsoe will deliver its HydroFlex™ technology, which enables the production of SAF and renewable diesel from renewable feedstocks including agricultural waste, fats, oils and greases.
- The licensing agreement is between Topsoe and Cepsa and represents Topsoe’s first HydroFlex™ order in Spain.

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, has signed an agreement with Cepsa, a leading international company committed to sustainable mobility. According to the agreement, Topsoe will provide its HydroFlex™ technology for the production of SAF and renewable diesel at the new plant of Cepsa’ Bioenergia San Roque (CBSR) , a joint venture between Cepsa and Bio-Oils Energy, part of Apical Group, in Palos de la Frontera, Spain.

**Elena Scaltritti, Chief Commercial Officer at Topsoe, said:**“We are excited to have been selected as the technology provider for this important project. The demand for SAF and renewable diesel is there, but supply is still lagging behind. Renewable fuels will be absolutely critical to support the energy transition – in particular in sectors such as long-distance transportation that are difficult to electrify. Cepsa delivers a meaningful contribution to decarbonizing the transportation sector, and we’re proud to be working with them.”

The plant, which began construction in February 2024, is expected to flexibly produce 500,000 tons of SAF and renewable diesel annually. With this new plant CBSR will be doubling their total renewable fuels production capacity to 1 million tons per year and thereby creating one of the largest renewable fuel complexes in Southern Europe.

The production serves to address the rapidly growing demand for SAF. As cited by the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Scenario, over 10% of fuel consumption in aviation needs to be SAF by 2030 to stay on course for net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. In 2022, the International Air Transport Association estimated global SAF production to make up only around 0.1% to 0.15% of total jet fuel demand.

**José Manuel Martínez, Director of Technology, Projects, and Services at Cepsa, said:**“This new 2G plant is central to our Positive Motion strategy and will set the European benchmark in the field of green molecules, directly supporting the rapid decarbonization of sectors that cannot run on electrons, like aviation. The new facility will emit 75% less CO2 than a traditional biofuel plant and is designed to achieve net zero emissions in the medium term. In Topsoe we have identified an outstanding partner, with proven technology and a track record of successfully delivering on its promises. We look forward to progressing construction to significantly increase production of this key renewable fuel.”**Lamberto Gaggiotti, Head of Green Energy at Apical Group**, said:“Our partnership withCepsa andTopsoe is truly synergistic, as it heralds a new era for the aviationand transportationindustriesintheirdecarbonization journey. Asa major global feedstock supplier,andthe key feedstock supplier to thisnew 2G biofuels plant, Apical is thrilled to collaborate with Cepsa and Topsoe in creating a transformative solution that will see our collective vision of converting waste to value,and producing high-grade,renewablefuelsbecome a reality."

**About HydroFlex™**With HydroFlex™, customers can convert various fats, oils and greases into drop-in renewable jet and diesel that meet all globally accepted specifications for these fuels. Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or fully renewable applications.
