# World’s largest green hydrogen project will use Haldor Topsoe ammonia technology

*Published: July 12, 2020*

- A $5 billion dollar green hydrogen production facility to be sited in NEOM, Saudi Arabia, will include Topsoe’s proven ammonia technology.
- The planned green ammonia loop will be the world’s largest on a par with the Gulf Coast Ammonia facility to be built in Texas, US, which will also use Topsoe ammonia technology.
- The NEOM project to produce 650 tons per day of carbon-free hydrogen to power buses and trucks around the world is equally owned by partners Air Products, ACWA Power, and NEOM. Air Products will be the exclusive off-taker of the green ammonia and intends to transport it around the world to be dissociated to produce carbon-free hydrogen for the transportation market.

The NEOM project will use about 4 GW of renewable power from solar, wind, and storage to produce 650 tons per day of carbon-free hydrogen. Using Topsoe’s proven technology, the hydrogen will be converted into 3,500 tons per day – or 1.2 million tons per year – of green ammonia.

The conversion of hydrogen into ammonia is an innovative approach to facilitate safe and reliable transport and storage of the green fuel, using existing, well-proven infrastructure.

Air Products will be the exclusive off-taker of the green ammonia produced at the NEOM site and intends to transport it around the world to be converted back into carbon-free hydrogen at local hydrogen refueling stations. Air Products’ focus is to supply hydrogen fuel cell buses and trucks with carbon-free hydrogen by 2025. The distribution to end customers represents an additional investment of two billion dollars by Air Products.

When implemented, the project avoids all emissions from the equivalent of over 700,000 cars, including over three million tons per year of CO2.

“We are honored to be part of this innovative world-scale project to reduce carbon emissions. Topsoe is focused on improving energy efficiency in today’s technologies while developing the solutions of the future. This is a great step ahead,” says Amy Hebert, Deputy CEO and EVP, Chemicals, Haldor Topsoe.
