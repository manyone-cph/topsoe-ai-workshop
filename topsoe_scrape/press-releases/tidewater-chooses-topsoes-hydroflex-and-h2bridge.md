# Tidewater chooses Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™ technologies for renewable diesel production

*Published: April 14, 2021*

- Tidewater Midstream and Infrastructure Ltd. (Tidewater) will utilize Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™ technologies to produce approximately 3,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel from its proposed renewable diesel facility.
- Topsoe will deliver engineering, license, proprietary equipment, and catalyst for its HydroFlex™ and H2bridgeTM
- Construction work is expected to begin shortly, contingent upon receipt of Tidewater’s final investment decision. The facility is expected to be commissioned as early as 2023.

Topsoe has signed a contract with Tidewater for the delivery of Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ technology in Canada. The technology will be utilized in a new 3,000 barrels per day renewable diesel facility that, subject to receipt of Tidewater’s final investment decision, will be constructed at the site of Tidewater’s existing Prince George refinery in British Columbia, Canada. When operational, the facility is expected to be Canada’s first commercial-scale stand-alone renewable diesel plant.

The renewable diesel facility will be focused on 100% renewable feedstock and will include a pretreatment facility to provide Tidewater significant flexibility on running various renewable feedstocks.

“We are proud that Tidewater has chosen our HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™ technologies for their new renewable diesel facility. This is a testimony of our ability to deliver market-leading, low carbon emission solutions to the refinery industry,” says Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director of Haldor Topsoe, The Americas.

“Tidewater is excited to progress our effort in carbon reduction through the development of our renewable initiatives. Topsoe’s technology will contribute to our ability to support our customers with significantly less carbon intensive products,” said Joel MacLeod, Tidewater Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

HydroFlex™ is the industry-leading technology for production of renewable jet and diesel. This commercially proven technology provides refiners with lower CAPEX, lower OPEX, lower carbon intensity (CI) score, and better diesel yield. HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or stand-alone applications.

Topsoe’s H2bridge™ delivers a circular solution to refineries and biorefineries by replacing fossil feedstocks with renewable LPG or naphtha to produce renewable hydrogen, thereby generating significant greenhouse gas emissions savings and lower the carbon intensity of the renewable fuels produced in the HydroFlex™ unit.
