# World’s first of its kind green ammonia plant inaugurated by Skovgaard Energy, Vestas, and Topsoe

*Published: August 27, 2024*

- A significant milestone achieved as the Danish partnership of Topsoe, Skovgaard Energy, and Vestas inaugurated a green ammonia plant in Ramme, Northwest Jutland, Denmark.
- The plant will demonstrate how renewable power can be coupled directly to an ammonia plant while taking the fluctuations in power production into account, and simultaneously making it a cost-effective way of producing green ammonia.
- The partnership has received DKK 81 million (app. EUR 11 million) in funding from the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP).

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, and its partners Skovgaard Energy and Vestas have inaugurated a new green ammonia plant in Ramme, Denmark.

The plant will demonstrate a dynamic approach, which entails that the plant will adapt to the inherent fluctuations in power output from the renewable power sources in integration with the plant’s electrolysis and ammonia synthesis loop. This will ensure optimal production and improve cost-effectiveness. With the power coming from renewable sources, the produced ammonia will be labelled as green ammonia.

Ammonia – either in the form of low-carbon ammonia or as an e-fuel – is expected to play a critical role in the world’s journey towards net zero: It can be transported using existing infrastructure; and it has multiple end-uses, not only as a fuel or hydrogen carrier but also to help decarbonize industrial processes like steel and cement production.

**Kim Hedegaard, CEO Power-to-X at Topsoe, said:**“With this new facility, we are taking an important step, which will benefit both Denmark and the rest of the world. We need to continue the development of green alternatives for energy-intensive industries and long-distance transportation with research, innovation and action. This project is a unique example of going from good intentions to actively supporting the energy transition.”

**Niels Erik Madsen, CEO at Skovgaard Energy, said:**“We have achieved a milestone in Denmark. Until today, we have been able to supply plenty of green power to the power grid, but we have not been able to store it or convert it to the needs of industry. We are now able to do just that, when we turn green electricity into green ammonia.”

**Facts about the green ammonia plant in Denmark**

- The plant is a demonstration project, which have received funding from theDanish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP)
- Location: Ramme near Lemvig, Northwest Jutland, Denmark.
- Output: 5,000 tons of green ammonia annually from renewable power. This production will prevent 8,200 tons of CO2from being emitted into the atmosphere every year.
- Power supplied from renewable sources: 50 MW new solar panels and 12 MW existing V80-2.0 MW Vestas wind turbines.
