# Topsoe to provide technology for one of Brazil’s first commercial scale sustainable aviation fuel production plants

*Published: November 13, 2024*

- Refinaria Riograndense, based in Rio Grande, Brazil, aims to produce 16,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
- Topsoe will deliver its HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™ technologies, enabling SAF and renewable diesel production fromsoybean oil and tallow feedstocks.
- When Refinaria Riograndense’s plant is in full operation, Topsoe’s technology will expectedly enable an annual emission avoidance of more than2 million tonnes of CO2e – the equivalentof avoiding the emissions from more than 240.000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven for a year.
- The plant is expected tobe operational in first half of 2028.

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, has signed an agreement with Refinaria de Petróleo Riograndense SA (Riograndense), to provide its HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™ technologies for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel production at Riograndense’s Rio Grande renewable fuels plant in Brazil.

The production addresses the rapidly growing demand for SAF. As cited by the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Scenario, over 10% of fuel consumption in aviation needs to be SAF by 20301to stay on course for net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. In 2023, the International Air Transport Association estimated global SAF production to make up only around 0.2% of total jet fuel demand2.

**Elena Scaltritti, Chief Commercial Officer at Topsoe, said:**“With Brazil setting ambitious airline emissions reduction targets in October this year, Riograndense is one of the country’s early movers to ensure SAF supply is available for airline operators on-time. We look forward to partnering with Riograndense to grow the supply of renewable fuels in Brazil.”

******Felipe Jorge, Managing Director at Riograndense, said:**“We believe Topsoe is the right partner for Riograndense to progress towards the total conversion to a biorefinery, which will allow us to become a reference in the SAF production in Brazil. “

The agreement with Riograndense follows a number of wins announced by Topsoe for the roll-out of its HydroFlex™ technology, including[HOLBORN’s](https://www.topsoe.com/press-releases/topsoe-chosen-as-technology-provider-for-holborns-hamburg-renewable-fuels-refinery)Hamburg renewable fuels refinery,[Braya Renewable Fuels’](https://www.topsoe.com/press-releases/topsoes-hydroflex-technology-utilized-by-canadian-startup-braya-renewable-fuels-to-produce-renewable-diesel)Come By Chance plant in Canada,[Cepsa Bioenergia San Roque’s](https://www.topsoe.com/press-releases/topsoe-to-supply-technology-for-one-of-southern-europes-largest-renewable-fuels-plants)Palos de la Frontera plant in Spain, and[Guangxi Hongkun Biomass](https://www.topsoe.com/press-releases/topsoe-secures-first-sustainable-aviation-fuel-project-in-china)in China.

**About HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™**With HydroFlex™, customers can convert various fats, oils and greases into drop-in renewable jet and diesel that meet all globally accepted specifications for these fuels. Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or fully renewable applications.

The H2bridge™ technologyreplaces external fossil feedstocks for production of hydrogen byprocessing the waste propane and off gases from the HydroFlex™process and converting it into green hydrogen that is then consumed in the same process (i.e. HydroFlex™). This patented process integration provides the customers with improved carbon intensity score.

**About Riograndense**The history of oil refining in Brazil began in the city of Rio Grande. The Riograndense Oil Refinery, which began working in 1937, is now owned by Petrobras, Braskem and Ultrapar.

The company’s main operations are currently the processing and sale of petroleum derivatives, particularly gasoline, diesel oil, petrochemical naphtha, fuel oil, LPG (domestic gas) and other products. Its market is concentrated in the south of Brazil, particularly the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The refinery has an installed processing capacity of 17 thousand barrels a day.
