# Haldor Topsoe is now Topsoe

*Published: April 7, 2022*

The world is changing, and so are we.

Today, the biggest global challenge is climate change, and we have made it our vision to become recognized as the global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies by 2024.

Recently,wehave created a new brand to front our vision and our journey to decarbonization at scale – still building on the strong and invaluable legacy of Dr. Haldor Topsøe.

As part of introducing a new brand, it was decided at our Annual General Meeting on Thursday April 7 2022, to change our company name from Haldor Topsoe A/S to Topsoe A/S. A company name already widely used, relatable, and a name that stands out.
