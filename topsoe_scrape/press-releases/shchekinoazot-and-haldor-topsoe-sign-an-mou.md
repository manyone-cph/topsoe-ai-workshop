# Shchekinoazot and Haldor Topsoe sign an MoU to jointly discover opportunities for CO2 emission reduction

*Published: April 28, 2021*

- Haldor Topsoe and Shchekinoazot have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the objective to reduce the carbon footprint of Shchekinoazot’s existing and future plants in Tula region, Russia.
- Shchekinoazot aims to establish production of green and blue methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen using Topsoe’s experience and technologies within reforming, electrolysis, carbon capture and utilization, and ammonia and methanol synthesis.
- Parties will collaborate to reduce CO2 emission from the existing production plants.

Topsoe and the leading Russian chemical company Shchekinoazot have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to synchronize vison and plans on developing blue and green methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen production and reducing CO2 emissions. At the online signing ceremony, parties agreed to inform each other on latest technological developments and jointly explore opportunities of implementing Topsoe’s technologies at Shchekinoazot’s plants to efficiently and safely produce high quality chemicals with the lowest rates of greenhouse gas emission.

“Our company’s vision is to be recognized as the global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies by 2024, and we are excited to share our groundbreaking technologies with our long-term partner Shchekinoazot,” says Roeland Baan, CEO and President of Haldor Topsoe A/S.

Topsoe is already engaged in several projects to produce green hydrogen, green ammonia, eMethanol, and efuels. An example is the Helios project in NEOM, Saudi Arabia, announced in July 2020, which includes the world’s largest ammonia loop (1.2 million tons per year) delivered by Topsoe. With the highly efficient SOEC electrolysis technology and decades of experience as a world-leading technology provider within ammonia, methanol, gasoline, jet-fuel, diesel, and hydrogen, Topsoe is one of the very few companies that can deliver insights, technology and catalysts along the entire value chain for low carbon emission fuels and chemicals.

“We believe that with Haldor Topsoe’s support we’ll be able to lead the green transformation and be one of the frontrunners who will blaze the trail for the Russian chemical industry. Saving the natural resources is an extremely important issue for all countries. Working for the world’s prosperity, which is one of our key principles, we keep on buying into environmental, ecological, human safety, and climate protection programs on an annual basis. I’m confident that working together with Topsoe in this area and practical steps towards reducing CO2 emissions are the key to proper development for ecology and industry,” says Boris Sokol, President of Shchekinoazot.

Shchekinoazot and Topsoe have worked together for the last 15 years and have successfully implemented five projects together related to ammonia, methanol and hydrogen production, applying technologies and catalysts developed and supplied by Topsoe.
