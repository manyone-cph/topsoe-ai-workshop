# Haldor Topsoe and Hyundai Oilbank sign Memorandum of Understanding to develop green energy solutions

*Published: November 7, 2021*

- Hyundai Oilbank and Topsoe will jointly seek to identify opportunities within blue and green hydrogen, waste plastic recycling, bio-refinery, eFuels, CCUS (carbon capture, utilization and storage) and other solutions to reduce carbon emissions.
- The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will support Topsoe in further optimizing its clean energy technologies and potentially enable Hyundai Oilbank to increase its low-carbon business and meet the company’s target that 70% of total profit should derive from eco-friendly business by 2030.

Both Topsoe and Hyundai Oilbank strive to mitigate climate change. Topsoe develops cutting-edge technologies within green hydrogen, green ammonia, eMethanol, and eFuels. Hyundai Oilbank has started a transformation of its production to significantly reduce carbon emissions in its customer offerings.

Under the MoU, the two parties will collaborate on developing sustainable and efficient solutions within a range of green energy solutions.

“We’re very satisfied to support Hyundai Oilbank in their efforts to transform their business model to sustain a green future, and we look forward to further optimizing our green energy technologies together,” says Chokri Mousaoui, Executive Vice President and Head of Green Hydrogen at Topsoe.
