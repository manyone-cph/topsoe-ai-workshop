# Topsoe technology supports HF Sinclair’s renewable fuels production in the United States

*Published: July 4, 2023*

- HF Sinclair’s renewable diesel units in Sinclair, Wyoming, Cheyenne, Wyoming and Artesia, New Mexico are successfully producing renewable fuels.
- The renewable units in Cheyenne (6,000 BPD) and Sinclair (10,000 BPD) are from the conversion of crude oil refinery assets whereas the Artesia (9,000 BPD) renewable unit is a grassroots renewable facility.
- The renewable diesel at these HF Sinclair facilities is produced using Topsoe’s licensed HydroFlex

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, was selected by HF Sinclair as a technology provider for their production of renewable fuels at three facilities: Sinclair, Cheyenne and Artesia. All three facilities have now successfully been put into operation and deliver renewable diesel into the United States transportation market.

These facilities utilize Topsoe’s HydroFlexTMtechnology for the conversion of waste and bio-feedstock into renewable diesel.

Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director, The Americas, Topsoe, says:“We are excited to deliver technology for the production of highly sought-after low-carbon fuels to the US transportation markets. It’s a pleasure collaborating with HF Sinclair on these very successful projects.”

Valerie Pompa, Executive Vice President, Operations, HF Sinclair, said: “HF Sinclair is now one the largest producers of renewable fuels in the United States. By implementing Topsoe’s carbon emission reduction technology, HydroFlex™, at three of our facilities, we are able to further advance our sustainability efforts.”

**What are renewable fuels?******Renewable fuels are low-carbon fuels made from renewable sources that are chemically identical to regular petroleum diesel or jet fuel. These renewable fuels produce less greenhouse gas emissions while performing the same as regular petroleum diesel or jet fuel. They can be used as a drop-in fuel without modification to engines or infrastructure. Renewable fuels are made from waste, animal fats, and used cooking oils, as well as organic materials such as soybean oils.

**What is HydroFlex™**With HydroFlex™, customers can convert low-value feedstocks into drop-in renewable jet and diesel that meets all of the globally accepted specifications for these fuels. The innovative HydroFlex™ process layout offers lower capital expenditure (CAPEX), but also a lower energy consumption during operation, resulting in a lower Carbon Index (CI). Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or stand-alone applications. HydroFlex™ is by far the most successful renewable fuels technology globally.**About Topsoe******Founded in 1940, Topsoe is a leading global developer and supplier of decarbonization technology, catalysts, and services for the energy transition.
