# Arbor Renewable Gas chooses Topsoe’s TIGAS™ technology for renewable gasoline

*Published: September 1, 2021*

- Arbor Renewable Gas, LLC (Arbor Gas) will use Topsoe’s TIGASTMtechnology for producing renewable gasoline at a new facility in the Gulf Coast region.
- The facility will expectedly be operational by 2024 to produce 1,000 barrels per day of renewable gasoline with a significantly negative carbon intensity score under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard.
- The use of this fuel by consumers avoids the emission of at least 250,000 tons of CO2 to the atmosphere every year.
- Topsoe will supply the methanol synthesis technologies and the backend gasoline synthesis unit (TIGAS™). The methanol synthesis loop is based on themodular MeOH-To-Go™ design.

“We are proud that Arbor Gas has chosen our technology for this truly innovative project to decarbonize transportation fuels. By contributing with our world-leading TIGAS™ technology,a uniquely integrated solution, incorporating the full value chain from syngas to methanol into gasoline,we support Arbor Gas in their efforts toaccelerate the U.S. transition to low carbon fuels, shaping a more diverse and sustainable transportation system,” said Fei Chen, Senior Vice President at Topsoe.

Arbor Gas is pursuing decarbonization solutions that make a real difference in the vast transportation fuels arena. The waste woody biomass will be converted into renewable gasoline and hydrogen by utilizing cutting-edge technology. By utilizing waste biomass as the feedstock, Arbor Gas achieves a double benefit by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise be produced from decaying wood and at the same time displacing the use of traditional hydrocarbon-based transportation fuels. The renewable gasoline will be for markets that value a low carbon fuel as a direct drop-in fuel.

“We are excited to be deploying Haldor Topsoe’s cutting edge MeOH-To-Go™ and TIGAS™ technology in the world’s first commercial scale renewable gasoline plant, a significant step forward in the formation of meaningful transition fuel volumes” said Timothy E. Vail, CEO of Arbor Gas. He went on to say, “Haldor Topsoe’s long commitment and significant investment in the technology gave us the confidence that our plant can be built on-budget, with a realistic schedule, providing efficient operations that will operate safely for many decades to come.”
