# Topsoe exiting Russia and Belarus

*Published: April 28, 2022*

Topsoe is closing down its operations in Russia and Belarus including its office in Moscow.The close down follows Topsoe’s earlier decision to make a full stop for all new business activity in Russia and Belarus.

“We are horrified about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that leaves the Ukrainian people to suffer. Immediately after the invasion, we chose to go even further than the imposed sanctions and put a full stop for all new business activity in Russia and Belarus, as we did not want to support this illicit and brutal aggression from Russian side,” Roeland Baan, CEO of Topsoe, said.

Topsoe is currently in the process of settling all formal obligations in Russia and Belarus including voluntary liquidation and expects to have exited the countries within a few months. This also includes closing down Topsoe’s office in Moscow, which currently employs around 80 people.

“My deepest concern related to our exit is our talented colleagues in Moscow, who have been part of the company for years. We all deeply care for our affected colleagues, and fortunately we have found appropriate jobs for some of them in other parts of our global oriented organization,” Roeland Baan said.
