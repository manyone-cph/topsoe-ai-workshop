# Topsoe ammonia technology to boost Approtium's hydrogen production in South Korea

*Published: February 19, 2024*

- Topsoe has signed an engineering agreement with Approtium to convert low-carbon ammonia into hydrogen using its H2RETAKE™ technology.
- Approtium plans to build an ammonia cracking plant to produce 75,000 metric tons of low-carbon hydrogen annually.
- The plant will be built in Ulsan, South Korea, and production is expected to start in 2027.

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, has signed an engineering agreement with Approtium, a leading South Korean industrial supplier of hydrogen, to deliver its proven ammonia cracking technology, H2RETAKE™, converting low-carbon ammonia, also referred to as blue ammonia, back into hydrogen.

Topsoe will deliver its technology to Approtium’s landmark project in Ulsan, South Korea. The facility is projected to produce 75,000 metric tons of hydrogen annually, which will support South Korea’s growing need for co-firing in the power generation sector. The project contributes significantly to South Korea’s target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions with 40% in 2030 (2018 as baseline).

**Elena Scaltritti, Chief Commercial Officer at Topsoe, said:**"We are excited to embark on this project with Approtium, showcasing not onlythe potential ofour innovative technology, but also the strengths of ammonia as a key energy carrier. Greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced drastically on a global scale and through this project, Topsoe delivers a strong contribution to support South Korea’s decarbonization targets."

**James Kim****, CEO of Approtium, said:**"Our ultimate goal has been to provide clean hydrogen to clients and contribute to accelerate carbon neutrality in Korea. This collaboration with Topsoe marks a significant milestone in our relentless pursuit of that goal and signifies our commitment to providing value to both our clients and society."

**What is****H2RETAKE™**H2RETAKE™ is Topsoe’s ammonia cracking technology, designed for the high-efficiency conversion of ammonia into high-purity hydrogen, with an energy efficiency of 96%. It produces high-quality hydrogen suitable for various industrial applications. A unique feature of H2RETAKE™ is its ability to use off-gases as fuel for the endothermic reaction, enhancing its overall efficiency. It can process any commercial-grade ammonia feed source, demonstrating its adaptability in different operational contexts for hydrogen production.

**About Approtium**Approtium, founded in 1964, is the largest domestic supplier in hydrogen and liquid CO2. Since its establishment, Approtium has continually expanded its business, establishing three different facilities in Ulsan, as well as a fourth factory in Seosan, Chungnam. Approtium currently supplies approximately 100,000 tons of hydrogen annually to a large number of industrial consumers within diverse set of sectors such as refining, petrochemicals, and semiconductors.More information can be found at www.approtium.com.
