# A brighter horizon for sustainable aviation fuel:​ Sasol and Topsoe to form a future business to accelerate global SAF production

*Published: June 21, 2023*

Sasol, the global chemicals and energy company, andTopsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, have signed a landmark agreement toestablish a 50/50 joint venture (subject to approval by relevant authorities), solidifying their commitment to produce sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and contribute to global efforts in combating climate change.

Global mobility connecting people, cultures and businesses across continents allows progress and freedom, but it also comes with the challenge of carbon emissions. Theaviation sector alone contributes 2-3% of global carbon emissions. Sustainable aviation fuels decarbonizing air transport are called for globally by industry and regulators.The future joint venture will ‘go beyond’ the unique combination of technologies, capabilities and deep industry experienceto lay the foundation to ‘go beyond’ in theproduction scaling of sustainable aviation fuels.

The purpose of the Sasol Topsoe JV is to develop, build, own, and operate sustainable aviation fuel plants, and market sustainable aviation fuels derived primarily from non-fossil feedstock, utilizing green hydrogen, sustainable sources of CO2 and/or biomass with a specific focus on Sasol’s FischerTropschandTopsoe’srelated technologies.Together, this proven partnership intends to bring future-proof solutions to the market.

Fleetwood Grobler, Sasol President and CEO, highlighted the long-term ambitions of Sasol in sustainable aviation fuel, stating:*"Sasol is delighted to join forces with**Topsoe**,**furthering our global sustainable aviation fuel aspiration. This is an important milestone in advancing our long-term strategy to become net zero by 2050. As we transform our business to focus on decarbonization while preserving and growing value, this JV is testament to the decades of collaboration between our two companies.”*

Roeland Baan, CEO atTopsoe, expressed his enthusiasm for this milestone, stating:

*“As part of our proven partnership, this future business is an important moment of**progress at a critical time. We need to keep the world open by creating more sustainable ways of flying, and our shared commitment to accelerating sustainable aviationfuels is a vital part of this. We believe no one is better placed than the company formed by Sasol and**Topsoe**to deliver the means to scale SAF production”.*​
