# Haldor Topsoe to deliver Blue Ammonia technology for Air Products’ landmark $4.5 billion clean energy complex in Louisiana, USA

*Published: October 17, 2021*

- The facility will be built in Ascension Parish, Louisiana US, by Air Products and will expectedly be operational in 2026.
- The facility willavoid the emission of over five million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissionsper year.
- Topsoe will deliver its Blue Ammonia synthesis technology, proprietary hardware and catalysts.

Air Products will build a landmark megaproject, which will produce over 750 million standard cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen. A portion of the blue hydrogen will be compressed and supplied by Air Products’ U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline network to customers. The balance of the blue hydrogen will be used to make blue ammonia that will be transported around the world and converted back to blue hydrogen for transportation and other markets.

“We are happy to support Air Products in their rapid expansion of renewable offerings through our partnership framework. We believe that this significant project will showcase our unique ammonia technology in a true world-scale setting,” says Roeland Baan, CEO at Haldor Topsoe.

”The strength of our global alliance agreement with Haldor Topsoe, providing access to technology-leading capabilities, continues to be reinforced through our latest, large-scale project – a landmark complex in Louisiana that will help meet cleaner energy needs in the U.S. Gulf Coast and around the world,” says Dr. Samir J. Serhan, COO at Air Products.

Topsoe and Air Products already have a well-established collaboration with Topsoe delivering technology for Gulf Coast Ammonia’s world-scale ammonia facility in Texas City (3,600 MTPD), Texas, and Topsoe will also provide its SynCOR™ blue hydrogen technology to Air Products’ recently announced blue hydrogen complex in Alberta, Canada.

Blue ammonia is an environmentally friendly way of producing ammonia with integrated carbon capture and storage (CCS) to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.
