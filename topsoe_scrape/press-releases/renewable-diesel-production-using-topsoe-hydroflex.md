# Topsoe HydroFlex™ being used in renewable diesel production at Phillips 66 refinery

*Published: August 9, 2021*

- In April, production of renewable diesel at Phillips 66’s refinery in Rodeo, California, began, and Phillips 66 now reports successful start-up at the 9,000 barrels-per-day facility.
- The existing hydrotreater has the ability to produce renewable diesel from pretreated vegetable oils.

Phillips 66’s refinery in Rodeo, California.“We are thrilled that Phillips 66 has chosen Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ technology for the production of renewable diesel at the Rodeo Refinery. This market-leading technology will provide Phillips 66 with a very low carbon intensity diesel fuel,” says Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director, The Americas, Haldor Topsoe.

With HydroFlex™, customers can convert low value feedstocks to renewable fuels that qualify for the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credit. The innovative HydroFlex™ process layout offers lower capital expenditure (CAPEX), but also a lower energy consumption during operation, resulting in a lower Carbon Index (CI). Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or stand-alone applications.
