# Haldor Topsoe joins United Nations Global Compact

*Published: May 26, 2020*

- Haldor Topsoe has joined the United Nations Global Compact, the world’s largest sustainability initiative.
- By becoming a part of the initiative, Topsoe commits to aligning policies and action with the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact.
- Joining the initiative reaffirms the company’s continuous commitment to building the business around responsible and transparent practices.

In joining the UN Global Compact, members commit to aligning policies and action with the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. The principles provide companies with clear guidelines on responsible business practices within areas such as human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption.

“We are pleased to be a part of this global initiative. Joining the UN Global Compact reaffirms our existing commitment to building our business around responsible and transparent practices. It aligns well with our continuous strive to create sustainable solutions that make a difference in the world of today – and tomorrow. We look forward to engaging with peers to collaboratively learn and promote sustainable development globally,” says Christian Stender, Compliance & Sustainability Director.

Topsoe is currently making an extensive assessment of how the company’s solutions impact the world’s global challenges following the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework. The assessment is expected to be finalized later this year.
