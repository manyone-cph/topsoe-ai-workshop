# CVR Energy, Inc. subsidiary selects Haldor Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ technology for revamp to renewable diesel production

*Published: January 26, 2021*

- CVR Energy, Inc. subsidiary will base a revamp of its Oklahoma, US, refinery on the HydroFlex™ technology to produce approximately 100 million gallons of renewable diesel per year.
- Topsoe will deliver basic engineering, license, proprietary equipment and catalyst for its HydroFlex™ technology.
- Construction work has begun for the $110 million project, scheduled to be completed in July 2021.

moreThe project will convert an existing hydrocracker for the production of low-carbon renewable diesel from soybean oil, resulting in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to hydrocarbon diesel. The renewable diesel is expected to meet the ASTM D975 diesel specification and qualify for programs such as the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

"By leveraging assets already in place, particularly the existing hydrocracker unit and underutilized hydrogen plant at our Wynnewood refinery, we believe we can deliver one of the lowest-cost renewable diesel projects in the industry,” says Dave Lamp, CEO & President of CVR Energy, Inc.

“We are very proud that CVR Energy, Inc. has chosen HydroFlex™ for this significant revamp project. This proven technology is the preferred choice for refiners leading the industry adaptation of renewable fuels, and it is a privilege to add yet another US project to our portfolio in line with Topsoe’s vision to be recognized as the world leader in carbon emission reduction technologies by 2024,” says Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director of Haldor Topsoe, The Americas.

Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ is the industry-leading technology for production of renewable jet and diesel. This commercially proven technology provides refiners with lower CAPEX, lower OPEX, and better carbon intensity (CI) score. HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or stand-alone applications.
