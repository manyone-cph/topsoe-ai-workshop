# Haldor Topsoe and Aker Carbon Capture to cooperate on low-carbon hydrogen solutions

*Published: December 20, 2020*

- Aker Carbon Capture and Haldor Topsoe have signed a memorandum of understanding with the intention to offer a complete solution for low-carbon hydrogen production.
- The solution combines Haldor Topsoe’s proven hydrogen process and Aker Carbon Capture’s post combustion carbon capture technology to achieve low-emission and cost-effective production of ‘blue’ hydrogen – a clean energy carrier with a wide array of applications in industry and as a fuel.
- The European Union foresees investments of €11 billion for retrofitting half of the existing European hydrogen plants with carbon capture and storage before 2030.

more”The collaboration with Aker Carbon Capture is an exciting opportunity to support customers in lowering their emissions from hydrogen production. Haldor Topsoe is a world leader in technology to produce hydrogen, and we are determined to lead the transition towards significant reductions in carbon emissions in this field and others,” says Amy Hebert, Chief Commercial Officer of Haldor Topsoe.

Decarbonizing the existing hydrogen market by adding carbon capture is a key to unlock the emerging hydrogen market in Europe, and the collaboration between Aker Carbon Capture and Haldor Topsoe aims to accelerate this process. The two companies intend to enter into a formal cooperation agreement in early 2021 and approach market opportunities.

“We are very pleased to team up with Haldor Topsoe to develop and deliver sustainable solutions for the existing hydrogen market. Aker Carbon Capture’s proprietary amine capture technology is complementary with Haldor Topsoe’s hydrogen process, and together we can offer an integrated solution to the market,” says Valborg Lundegaard, chief executive officer of Aker Carbon Capture.
