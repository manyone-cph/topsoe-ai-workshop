# Seaboard Energy has chosen Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ technology to produce renewable diesel

*Published: May 13, 2021*

- Seaboard Energy has chosen Haldor Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ renewable fuel technology to produce extremely clean renewable diesel from tallow and soybean oil.
- The 6,500 barrels-per-day renewable diesel unit is currently under construction at Seaboard Energy’s site in Hugoton, Kansas, and is scheduled for operation at the end of 2021.
- Topsoe will also provide H2bridge™hydrogen technology based on the modular and highly efficient Haldor Topsoe Convection Reformer™ (HTCR) technology.

Topsoe is the licensor and supplier of basic engineering, proprietary equipment, catalyst, and technical services for Seaboard Energy’s renewable fuels complex in Hugoton, Kansas, US. The project is based on HydroFlex™, a world-leading, industry-proven Topsoe technology to produce renewable fuels from a wide variety of renewable feedstocks.

“We chose Topsoe after a very thorough investigation into the technologies available in the market. Topsoe’s solution does not only promise the highest yield; it was also the least complicated and most efficient to implement. The fact that Topsoe can deliver the integrated hydrogen unit along with the hydroprocessing unit was important for us as well. Finally, our visit to Topsoe’s R&D facilities emphasized to us that we are working with a world-leader in the field,” says Gary Louis, President and CEO, Seaboard Energy.

“We are very proud that Seaboard Energy has chosen HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™ for their strategic expansion into renewable diesel. Seaboard is an impressive organization with businesses in many different industries. We look forward to starting up this plant with our friends from Seaboard,” says Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director, The Americas, Haldor Topsoe Inc.

With HydroFlex™, customers can convert low value feedstocks to renewable fuels that qualify for the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credit. The innovative HydroFlex™ process layout offers lower capital expenditure (CAPEX), but also a lower energy consumption during operation, resulting in a lower Carbon Index (CI). Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or stand-alone applications.
