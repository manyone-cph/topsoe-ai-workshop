# Topsoe signs first Australian green ammonia contract with Allied Green Ammonia

*Published: November 15, 2023*

- Allied Green Ammonia Pty Ltd (Allied) has selected Topsoe’s dynamic green ammonia technology for an ammonia plant in Gove, Northern Territory, Australia
- Allied’s facility is planned to start producing green ammonia in Q4 2028/Q1 2029 with a production capacity of 2,500 metric tons per day (MTPD)
- Topsoe and Allied are in discussions for the supply of an undisclosed quantity of Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC) to produce green hydrogen.

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, is pleased to have signed a contract with Allied, a developer of energy infrastructure projects, to deliver its dynamic green ammonia technology for Allied’s project in Gove, Northern Territory, Australia.

The produced green ammonia is intended to be exported from Gove to the expanding South East Asian markets where demand for e-fuels continues to grow. Production is planned to start in Q4 2028/Q1 2029, targeting a capacity of 2,500 MTPD.

Allied estimates that the project will create up to 2,000 direct construction jobs and 500 direct and indirect jobs for over 25 years. Using Topsoe’s technology, the CO2saved in this project is estimated to be around 1.4 million tons per year, compared to ammonia produced from conventional (natural gas) routes.

Topsoe is also in discussions with Allied to supply an undisclosed quantity of its SOEC to produce green hydrogen. The potential supply and integration of Topsoe’s SOEC technology for production of green hydrogen – in combination with the dynamic ammonia technology – will further increase the energy efficiency of Allied’s ammonia production.

**Kim Hedegaard, CEO Power-to-X, at Topsoe, said:**“We are excited to embark on this journey with Allied and to support the growing demand for e-fuels production in Australia. Allied’s project is completely in line with our ambition to deliver carbon reduction technologies for reaching net zero. Our dynamic green ammonia solution supports this by enabling the production of e-fuels for energy-intensive industries and long-distance transportation.”

**Alfred Benedict, Founder & Managing Director of Allied, said:**“We are confident that the geographical location and existing infrastructure in Gove in combination with the most energy efficient hydrogen and green ammonia technology will lead to the lowest levelized cost of green ammonia production in Australia. We are delighted to receive strong endorsement from the local Gumatj Corporation and the Northern Territory government, both of whom eagerly support the development of our green ammonia project in Gove."

**About dynamic ammonia technology**Topsoe’s dynamic ammonia technology, DynAMMO™, adapts the production output of green ammonia in response to fluctuating supply of renewable electricity.

The dynamic ammonia process plant will enable: 1) the ramping up/down of the ammonia production bidirectionally at a rate of at least 3% per minute in response to the fluctuating supply of hydrogen to the ammonia plant; 2) significant reduction in capital expenditure and operational expenditure since hydrogen storage systems can be reduced substantially, or otherwise eliminated; 3) Renewable electricity to be stored in a zero-carbon chemical.

Green ammonia has the ideal characteristics to enable net-zero because it can function both as a green fuel, an energy carrier and green fertilizer.

**About SOEC**Topsoe’s SOEC electrolysis technology is a modular design that leverages high-temperature electrolysis – a tested and proven process that enables industrial-scale production of green hydrogen using renewable electricity. Due to the nature of the high-temperature electrolysis, Topsoe’s SOEC technology produces 30 pct. more hydrogen per total power input when compared to conventional electrolyzer technologies.

Additionally, when coupled with waste heat-producing technologies (such as those used in ammonia, methanol, or steel production), SOEC allows for the lowest levelized hydrogen cost with the highest level of energy efficiency per megawatt volume, no matter the industry.

**About Allied Green Ammonia**Allied Green Ammonia is an Australian company registered with ASIC to design, develop, construct and operate a green ammonia production facility in Northern Territory, Australia.

While our investment and development mandates are broad, our primary strategy is to leverage our long-standing experience and investment & development track record in clean energy infrastructure projects. We aim to become an industry leader in producing green ammonia in Australia’s Northern Territory.[www.alliedgreen.com.au.](http://www.alliedgreen.com.au)
