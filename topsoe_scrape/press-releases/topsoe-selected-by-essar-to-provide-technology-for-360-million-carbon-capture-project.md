# Topsoe selected by Essar to provide technology for £360 million carbon capture project

*Published: December 22, 2023*

- Essar Oil UK (“Essar”) has selected Topsoe to provide its sustainable flue-gas treatment technology, SNOXTM, for Essar’s planned £360 million Essar Energy Transition (“EET") Industrial Carbon Capture (“ICC”) facility.
- The carbon capture facility will be an integral part of Essar’s Stanlow refinery in North West England.
- Essar’s carbon capture facility is expected to be operational by 2028, eliminating an estimated 1 million tons of CO2per year – the equivalent of taking 220,000 cars off the road.
- The captured CO2will be permanently sequestered in depleted gas fields under the sea in Liverpool Bay.

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, has been selected by Essar Oil UK, a leading integrated downstream energy company, to be a technology licensor for its carbon capture facility, based in Stanlow, North West England.

Topsoe will deliver its SNOX™ technology for the removal of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, dust and other contaminants from the flue gas emitted in the production process. Topsoe’s technology will be one of a number of integrated licensed solutions supporting Essar’s plant, and will contribute to reducing their CO2footprint.

**Elena Scaltritti, CCO, Topsoe, said:**“We are thrilled to have been chosen as technology licensor for Essar Oil UK and support them in meeting their decarbonization targets. The agreement represents a landmark step for Topsoe’s development in the United Kingdom, and we look forward to working with Essar on this important project, which is a great example of how the fossil industry can decarbonize itself.”

**Deepak Maheshwari, CEO of Essar Oil UK, said:**“We are ready to move into the next phase of Essar Oil UK’s decarbonization strategy. With an investment of $1.2 billion, Essar Oil UK is positioned to be the world’s first low carbon refinery. The industrial carbon capture facility, combined with our upcoming hydrogen fuel switching project, will reduce the refinery’s CO2emissions by 95%. Topsoe is a valuable partner in this endeavor. With Topsoe’s SNOX™ technology we are getting a well proven and highly sustainable flue-gas treatment.”

**What is SNOX™?**With SNOX™ technology, refineries, power plants, carbon black manufacture can remove sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, particulates and other contaminants from flue gases. The sulfur is recovered in the form of commercial grade concentrated sulfuric acid.The SNOX™process workswithout any consumption of water and limestone, and without generating any waste or ocean discharge.

**About Essar Oil UK**Essar Oil (UK) Ltd is committed to playing a key role in the decarbonization of the UK economy, with ambitious plans to build an energy transition cluster in the North West of England.

Essar Oil (UK) is transforming for tomorrow and is committed to becoming the UK’s first low-carbon refinery at the heart of HyNet, the UK’s leading industrial decarbonization cluster. It is investing $1.2 billion over the next five years to decarbonize its operations and targeting a 95% cut in emissions by 2030 through energy efficiency, carbon capture and fuel switching. This will deliver a 12.5% reduction of the North West’s overall regional carbon emissions.

Industrial carbon capture will deliver an annual emissions reduction of ~1 million tons of CO2and hydrogen fuel switching from natural gas to EET Hydrogen low carbon hydrogen as a fuel source will deliver an additional annual emissions reduction of ~1 million tons of CO2.

This investment ensures the sustainability of this critical national asset, supporting high value employment and UK energy security resilience.**About Topsoe**Topsoe is a leading global provider of technology and solutions for the energy transition. We combat climate change by helping our customers and partners achieve their decarbonization and emission reduction goals.
