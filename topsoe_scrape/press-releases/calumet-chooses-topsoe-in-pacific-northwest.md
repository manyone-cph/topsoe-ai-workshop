*Published: August 30, 2021*

- Revamp of Calumet’s existing hydrocracker In Great Falls, Montana refinery to utilize Haldor Topsoe’s HydroFlexTMsolution to produce 12,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel.
- This is a fast-track project and the revamp will be producing renewable diesel in the spring of 2022.

Calumet's refinery in Great Falls, Montana.“We are excited to support Calumet as they transition to the production of renewable fuels for the North American markets. Our HydroFlexTMsolution is designed to produce diesel based on renewable feedstock, with a minimal Carbon Intensity (CI score) compared to traditional diesel,” says Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director, The Americas, Haldor Topsoe.

“We have chosen Haldor Topsoe’s market-leading HydroFlex™ technology for this exceptional project that will allow us to lead the energy transition economy beginning in the Pacific Northwest. This growth project and our vision to source feedstocks locally will create value for the city of Great Falls; Calumet; the state of Montana; and North American low carbon fuel markets,” says Bruce Fleming, Executive Vice President, Calumet.

**What is HydroFlex™**With HydroFlex™, customers can convert low value feedstocks to renewable fuels that qualify for Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits. The innovative HydroFlex™ process layout offers lower capital expenditure (CAPEX), but also a lower energy consumption during operation, resulting in a lower Carbon Index (CI). Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or stand-alone applications.
