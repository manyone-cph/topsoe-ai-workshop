# Topsoe’s electrolyzer demonstration plant delivers strong results

*Published: March 20, 2024*

- Topsoe’s inaugural SOEC electrolyzer test demonstrate the technology’s capabilities as an electrolyzer in a hydrogen plant.
- The test reveals high levels of stability under industrial conditions while maintaining stable temperature levels.
- Topsoe will produce SOEC electrolyzers from its factory in Herning, Denmark, which is expected to be operational by 2024.

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, has reached an important milestone at the inaugural demonstration test for its Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) electrolysis technology.

Held at the Company’s demonstration site in Frederikssund, Denmark, Topsoe ran a 2,000-hour demonstration in industrial conditions of 12 SOEC stacks, which included 1,200 cells. The purpose was to demonstrate the technology’s capabilities in a hydrogen plant and validate the SOEC electrolyzers under industrial-standard intensity. After completion of the test, all 1,200 cells were shown to operate at high levels of stability while maintaining stable temperature levels.

**Kim Hedegaard, CEO Power-to-X at Topsoe, said:**“Net zero 2050 will only succeed, if we have the courage to deploy new pioneering technologies. The great test results demonstrate the capabilities of our SOEC technology. It is amuch more efficient solution to meet the need for a rapid decarbonization of our planet compared to conventional electrolysis technologies andready to make a positive impact in the Power-to-X industry.”

The demonstration is an important milestone in developing and scaling SOEC electrolysis technology, as well as Topsoe’s wider mission to enable the energy transition by bringing efficient, scalable, and innovative decarbonization technology to market.

The results further honor the trust put in Topsoe’s SOEC cells by the market and the EU Innovation Fund, who chose to award a EUR 94 million grant in December 2023 for Topsoe’s SOEC factory in Herning, Denmark.

This work has received financial support from the project “SOEC Upscale”, funded by European Regional Development Fund via the grant REACTRF-22-0076.

**About SOEC**Topsoe’s SOEC electrolysis technology is a modular design that operates at significantly higher temperatures compared to other electrolyzer technologies – a tested and proven process that enables industrial-scale production of green hydrogen using renewable electricity.

When coupled with waste heat from downstream production (from processes producing ammonia, methanol, or steel production), Topsoe’s SOEC technology will produces 30% more hydrogen per total power input when compared to conventional electrolyzer technologies. It further allows for the lowest levelized hydrogen cost per megawatt volume, no matter the industry.
