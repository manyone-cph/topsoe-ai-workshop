# Covenant Energy chooses Haldor Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™ solution to produce renewable diesel with low carbon footprint

*Published: June 16, 2021*

- Covenant Energy Ltd. (Covenant Energy) has chosen Haldor Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ renewable fuel technology to produce clean diesel from vegetable oil.
- The 6,500 barrels-per-day renewable diesel unit will be built inSaskatchewan, Canada, and is scheduled to go into operation early in 2024.
- Topsoe will also provide its H2bridge™ hydrogen technology based on the modular and highly efficient Haldor Topsoe Convection Reformer™ (HTCR) technology.

Covenant Energy’s new facility will produce renewable diesel with a significantly lower carbon footprint than conventional diesel and will thereby support Canada’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 under the country’s clean energy diversification strategy.

Topsoe has been chosen by Covenant Energy as the facility’s technology provider. Topsoe brings world-leading, industry-proven technology that will help Covenant Energy meet its projected renewable fuel demand.

“We are very pleased that Covenant Energy has selected Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™ technologies for this state of the art, standalone renewable diesel facility. These market-leading technologies are complementary and together they will provide Covenant with one of the lowest carbon intensity fuels in the world,“ says Henrik Rasmussen,Managing Director, The Americas, Haldor Topsoe Inc.

“Haldor Topsoe is an industry leader. Covenant Energy’s goal to produce the cleanest renewable diesel in the world, at Canada’s first of kind production facility, is made possible by Topsoe’s innovative technology. Our renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel will have a competitive advantageunder Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations,” says Josh Gustafson, President and CEO at Covenant Energy.

With HydroFlex™, customers can convert low value feedstocks to renewable fuels that qualify for the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credit. The innovative HydroFlex™ process layout offers lower capital expenditure (CAPEX), but also a lower energy consumption during operation, resulting in a lower Carbon Index (CI). Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or stand-alone applications.

Topsoe’s H2bridge™ delivers a circular solution to refineries and biorefineries by replacing fossil feedstocks with renewable LPG or naphtha to produce renewable hydrogen, thereby generating significant greenhouse gas emissions savings and lower the carbon intensity of the renewable fuels produced in the HydroFlex™ unit.
