# Topsoe selected by Santa Maria Renewable Resources LLC to deliver technology for renewable fuels project in Texas

*Published: November 28, 2023*

- Topsoe has signed licensing and engineering agreements with Santa Maria Renewable Resources LLC (Santa Maria) to provide its HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™ technologies to produce renewable fuels
- Santa Maria will build a grassroots plant to produce 3,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) of renewable diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)
- The facility will be built in the US in Texas, and plant is expected to start up in 2026.

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, has signed licensing and engineering agreements with Santa Maria to develop a project, focusing on the production of renewable fuels from various renewable feedstocks.

The proposed project, located in East Texas, plans to produce a combination of renewable diesel and SAF at a production capacity of 3,000 bbl/d. The project will contribute to reduce emissions in the long-distance transportation and aviation sectors.

The need for a rapid scale up of SAF production is important. Aviation, according to World Energy Outlook 2023, accounts for over 2% of all energy-related emissions, and today SAF constitutes less than 0.01% of fuel used for aviation.

Topsoe will provide its HydroFlex™ process layout integrated with the company’s H2bridge™ technology to further reduce the carbon intensity of the renewable jet and diesel produced from the plant.

**Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director, The Americas, Topsoe, said:**“We are thrilled to be partnering with Santa Maria on this project. Our shared commitment to support the renewable fuels market makes this collaboration a natural fit, and we look forward to seeing the positive impacts this project will bring.”

**Pat Sanchez, Founder and CEO, Santa Maria Renewable Resources LLC, said:**“Topsoe offers the optimal package of technical services for us to develop our renewable fuels project. The Topsoe team understands our value proposition and was very responsive towards deploying their proven technology in our integrated circular economy project.”

**What are renewable fuels?**Renewable fuels are low-carbon fuels that are chemically identical to regular petroleum diesel or jet fuel but made from renewable sources. These renewable fuels produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions while performing the same as conventional petroleum diesel or jet fuel. They can be used as a drop-in fuel without modification to engines or fueling infrastructure. Renewable fuels are made from waste oils, animal fats, virgin oils or liquefied solid waste.

­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­**What is HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™**With HydroFlex™, customers can convert various fat, oils and greases into drop-in renewable jet and diesel that meets all globally accepted specifications for these fuels. Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or stand-alone applications.

The H2bridge™ technologyreplaces external fossil feedstocks for production of hydrogen byprocessing the waste propane and off gases from the HydroFlex™process and converting it into green hydrogen that is then consumed in the same process (i.e. HydroFlex™). This patented process integration provides the customers with improved carbon intensity score.
