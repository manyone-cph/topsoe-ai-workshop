*Published: July 27, 2021*

- Haldor Topsoe and Shaanxi Yanchang Petroleum (Group) Co., Ltd. (Yanchang) form a joint venture with the aim of delivering locally produced MK-151+ methanol synthesis catalysts to the Chinese market.
- The joint venture will secure fast delivery to local customers, who demand high-performance catalysts for energy-efficient methanol production.
- Together, the two companies will build a production facility in Shaanxi Fupin in China to produce methanol synthesis catalysts.

Topsoe and Yanchang have designed the plant and ordered long lead time equipment and therefore plan on starting up beginning of 2022. The joint venture will produce methanol synthesis catalysts for the Chinese market.

“Yanchang is well-positioned in the oil and gas value chain and a very experienced methanol producer.
