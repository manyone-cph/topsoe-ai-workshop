# Successful startup of first TertiNOx™ catalyst reference to reduce harmful N₂O and NOx in nitric acid industry

*Published: December 13, 2020*

- The TertiNOx™ catalyst removes nitrous oxide (N₂O), also known as laughing gas, which is a very potent greenhouse gas with an estimated effect on global warming 298 times that of CO2.
- At the current performance level, Kavala Fertilizers’ nitric acid unit in Greece will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30.000 tons CO2equivalents per year.
- The first TertiNOx™ reference is one of the largest nitric acid producers in Greece.

Haldor Topsoe and Proton Ventures BV have announced a successful startup of the first TertiNOx™ catalyst reference at Kavala Fertilizers, one of the largest nitric acid producers in Greece. Topsoe has supplied both catalyst and basic engineering for the project. The plant has already exceeded its design conversion with N₂O emissions below 10 ppm, low ammonia slip, and practically eliminated NOx emissions.“With the new deNOx and N₂O removal system, we are very proud to be able to outperform the current Best Available Technologies achieving extremely low emission levels,” says Dr. Theodora Kouloura, COO, Kavala Fertilizers LTD.TertiNOx™ is a catalyst for removal of nitrous oxide also known as laughing gas. The catalyst is developed for the nitric acid industry where N₂O is formed as byproduct of the oxidation of ammonia. TertiNOx™ is also active for SCR reactions to remove NOx.N₂O is a very potent greenhouse gas, and even relatively small concentrations have a big negative impact on the climate. Apart from the environmental benefits, reducing N₂O emissions from nitric acid units is a cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and save on CO2credits.“We are thrilled to see the excellent performance and positive carbon reduction of Topsoe’s TertiNOx™ technology in its first application world-wide. Globally, it is very important to reduce emissions of the extremely potent greenhouse gas, N₂O, as well as NOx. This project has shown that TertiNOx™ does that in a very cost-effective and efficient way. We are extremely proud to fight climate change together with Proton Ventures and Kavala Fertilizers,” says Janus Münster-Swendsen, Business Development Manager at Haldor Topsoe.
