# Topsoe and Aramco to demonstrate groundbreaking low-carbon hydrogen production technology

*Published: October 9, 2023*

- Aramco and Topsoe collaborate to demonstrate the eREACT™ technology for low-carbon hydrogen production
- The technology is an emerging technology that converts natural gas into low-carbon hydrogen using renewable electricity
- Aramco and Topsoe will build a demonstration plant at the Shaybah Natural Gas Liquids recovery plant in Saudi Arabia
- The project aims to showcase the scalability and efficiency of the eREACT™ technology and its ability to reduce carbon emissions.

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, and Aramco, a global integrated energy and chemicals company, are pleased to announce a new collaboration to demonstrate the eREACT™ technology for the production of low-carbon hydrogen (or blue hydrogen).

Topsoe’s eREACT™ technology is a groundbreaking technology platform for production of low-carbon hydrogen and has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions. The hydrogen produced will hold a carbon intensity of near zero.

As part of the agreement, Aramco and Topsoe will build a demonstration plant at the Shaybah Natural Gas Liquids recovery plant in Saudi Arabia. In the project, renewable electricity will be used for electrified steam reforming of natural gas to produce low-carbon hydrogen, with the resulting CO2being sequestered.

**Elena Scaltritti, Chief Commercial Officer**at Topsoe, said: “We are thrilled to announce our collaboration with Aramco through which we demonstrate an innovative solution for producing low-carbon hydrogen. The cornerstone of this collaboration is Topsoe’s eREACT™, which is a groundbreaking technology platform producing low-carbon fuels and chemicals while eliminating flue gas emissions. This marks a crucial step in the transition to a net-zero future, and we couldn't be more excited to be at the forefront of this transformative change. We look forward to working with Aramco on this exciting project.”**What is eREACT™**eREACT™ is a novel technology for the production of low-carbon hydrogen and fuels. The heart of the technology is an innovative electrified reactor design, which is able to convert a variety of feedstocks into low-carbon hydrogen or other chemicals and fuels. The eREACT™ technology opens up new production routes combining renewable electricity and natural gas while eliminating flue gas emissions. Due to its versatility, the technology has the potential to play a significant role in the global transition to a low-carbon economy.
