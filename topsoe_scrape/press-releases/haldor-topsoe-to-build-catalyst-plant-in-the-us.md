# Haldor Topsoe to build catalyst plant in the U.S. to meet increasing demand for refining catalysts

*Published: July 12, 2021*

- Topsoe will build a 15,000 ton per year hydroprocessing catalyst plant at the company’s existing Bayport production site in Pasadena, Harris County, Texas.
- The plant will increase production capacity of Topsoe’s TK catalyst family to meet increasing demand, both in traditional refining and for use with Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ technology for production of renewable diesel and jet fuel.
- The plant is expected to be fully operational in the first half of 2023.

“We are happy to announce this significant investment which will reduce lead time and secure stable deliveries of Topsoe’s top-tier hydroprocessing catalysts to our customers in the U.S. and globally. We see increasing demand for our refining catalysts driven by an increasing global demand for clean fuels as well as the surge in renewable diesel production using our world-leading HydroFlex™ technology and our proprietary renewable fuel catalysts,” says Amy Hebert, Chief Commercial Officer, Topsoe.

The increased production capacity will also help meet growing demand for Topsoe’s hydroprocessing catalysts in the Middle East and South-East Asia.

“We are proud to be a member of the innovative and expanding business community in Harris County. Topsoe has a long-standing presence in Bayport where our plant has been in operation for more than 50 years. With this expansion, our operations here are secured for years to come, and the area will benefit from new jobs directly at the facility, as well as more business for our local service providers,” says Amy Hebert.

The new refining catalyst plant is an important step forward in the work to achieve Topsoe’s vision – to be recognized as the global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies by 2024.
