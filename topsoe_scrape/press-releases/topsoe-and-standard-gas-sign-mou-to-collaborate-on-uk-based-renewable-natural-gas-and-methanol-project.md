# Topsoe and Standard Gas sign MoU to collaborate on UK-based renewable natural gas and methanol project

*Published: November 30, 2023*

- Topsoe and Standard Gas Technologies (Standard Gas) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)to collaborate on a UK-based project to produce renewable natural gas and methanol from residual waste feedstocks
- Topsoe will supply its proprietary technologies, including its methanation and methanol technologies, for the project, which will either be owned and operated by Standard Gas or licensed to a third-party owner
- The first phase of collaboration will be an engineering study into the production of methanol from biogas and syngas.

Topsoe,a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, is pleased to have signed an MoU with Standard Gas, a decarbonization technology company, to collaborate on a UK-based project to produce renewable natural gas and methanol from residual waste feedstocks.

Under the terms of the MoU, Topsoe will provide the technologies, engineering, equipment items and catalysts that will enable the synthesis gas produced by Standard Gas to be processed into valuable products such as methane and methanol.

The process of renewable natural gas production will additionally producebiochar, which captures and removes carbon and can be sequestered in valuable products for the agricultural, construction and environmental industries.

Standard Gas will develop and obtain all appropriate approvals, licenses, funding and offtake agreements needed to implement the project. Standard Gas will either own and operate the potential project or license to a third-party owner.

**Peter Vang Christensen, Senior Vice President, Clean Fuels & Chemical at Topsoe, said:**“We are thrilled to be working with Standard Gas to address waste management, which continues to be a significant challenge to society. Standard Gas' visionary approach to waste management aligns with our own aspirations to be a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies. This MoU marks another step forward in our shared commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship.”

**Laurence Sharrock, Technical Director at Standard Gas, said:**“Topsoe is a perfect partner for this project given the company’s long, successful track record in the research and development of chemical process technology, which it has licensed on a global scale. Our SG100 technology has a significant contribution to make in combatting Climate Change, achieving Net Zero, and by converting municipal waste to a valuable feedstock without gaseous carbon emissions, it also benefits the UK economy’s efforts to become circular and regenerative.”

**About Standard Gas Technologies**Standard Gas is a decarbonization technology company providing energy solutions to accelerate the transition to Net Zero.

Its patented SG100 technology generates clean, renewable energy for homes and buildings, industry and transportation, and carbon-capturing biochar that can be sequestered in valuable products for the agricultural, construction and environmental industries.

The SG100 also provides a transformational alternative to the final disposal of waste through landfill and incineration, which generate emissions adding to atmospheric CO2.
