# Thaioil chooses SNOX™ air quality control for Sriracha refinery

*Published: August 3, 2021*

- Thai Oil Public Company Limited (Thaioil) has signed an agreement for Topsoe’s SNOX™ solution to efficiently remove sulfur and nitrogen oxides and dust emissions from their Sriracha Refinery in the Chonburi province in the east of Thailand.
- This is part of Thaioil’s 5-billion-dollar*Clean Fuel Project*to produce cleaner transport fuels in a more environmentally friendly way.
- The project is expected to boost capacity from 275,000 to 400,000 barrels per day – while improving energy efficiency and the impact on the environment.

moreThe agreement comprises proprietary equipment and catalyst supply for Haldor Topsoe's air quality control technology SNOX™. This initiative to secure compliance with air emission regulations for a new energy recovery unit at the Sriracha Refinery is part of Thaioil’s Clean Fuel Project.

The Sriracha Refinery’s new energy recovery unit will use three parallel SNOX™ lines to remove sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust from the new circulating fluidized bed boilers. Sulfur is recovered as commercial grade concentrated sulfuric acid and the nitrogen oxides are reduced to free nitrogen.

The SNOX™ process includes energy recovery by recycling of surplus heat to reduce energy consumption in the boilers. Another benefit of using SNOX™ in a refinery is that it can also handle additional sulfurous waste streams such as H2S gas, sour water stripper gas and Claus tail gas.

Thaioil has also chosen other Topsoe technologies and licenses for its new and environmentally friendly Sriracha Refinery, including hydrotreater.
