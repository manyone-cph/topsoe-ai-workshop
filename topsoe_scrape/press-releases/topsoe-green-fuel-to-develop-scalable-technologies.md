*Published: November 16, 2021*

- Green Fuel and Haldor Topsoe have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which will see the companies partnering to identify efficient and scalable technologies for the production of green ammonia in Iceland.
- The agreement also enables the two companies to explore other business opportunities within green ammonia.
- Green ammonia will be vital for the decarbonization of hard-to-abate industries such as shipping, heavy goods transport and agriculture.

Topsoe and Green Fuels are both already active in developing green solutions to help combat the climate challenge. The two parties are now collaborating to develop viable and efficient solutions, which could serve to establish Icelandic production of green ammonia.

Topsoe develops cutting edge new technologies within green hydrogen, green ammonia, eMethanol and efuels, and Green Fuel is a hydrogen and ammonia company that intends to be at the forefront of the energy transition. Green ammonia is seen as a future fuel which will play a vital role in the decarbonization of salient industries including shipping, heavy goods transportation and agriculture.

“Iceland offers large-scale volumes of the renewable power needed from its vast hydro and geothermal resources, and we see an exciting potential for the production of clean fuels,” says Tore Sylvester Jeppesen, Senior Vice President at Topsoe.

As part of its plan to produce green ammonia and green hydrogen in Iceland, Green Fuel has also secured a Letter of Intent to operate at Bakki Eco-Industrial Park in north-east Iceland.
