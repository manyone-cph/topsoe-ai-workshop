# First commercial eFuels-for-aviation plant in Denmark on schedule for 2026 - Arcadia selects Topsoe and Sasol technology

*Published: May 10, 2023*

- Arcadia eFuels selects Sasol and Topsoe as technology providers for the first commercial eFuels plant in Denmark
- The plant will be located in Vordingborg, Denmark, and will produce approx. 100 million litres per year of eFuels.

Arcadia eFuels (Arcadia), a leading developer of eFuels, Sasol, a global chemicals and energy company, and Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, havesigned a single license agreement for Arcadia’s Vordingborg eFuels plant.The signing of the agreement represents a major milestone in maturing the project and ahead of the next major milestone being Arcadia’s final investment decision.

The production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is not only important for the three companies, society is also in desperate need for low carbon alternatives to a fossil-fueled aviation industry. According to IATA – the International Aviation Transport Association – 2022 only saw around 300 million litres of SAF produced. This is compared to an estimated 450 billion litres per year needed for the airline sector to achieve net zero CO2emissions by 2050.Once operational, the plant will deliver eFuels for the Danish and European aviation markets to help meet the European Union mandate of 1.2% RFNBO (Renewable Fuels of non-Biological Origin) or eFuels in 2030.

Amy Hebert, CEO of Arcadia eFuels, said:“We’re pleased to conclude this license and engineering agreement with two best in class companies acting as a single point licensor. Their commercial experience in syngas, Fischer Tropsch and refining technology development and licencing combined with Arcadia’s novel engineering approach allows us speed to market. Meeting the needs of the aviation and heavy transportation industry’s decarbonization efforts is of high priority for Arcadia.”

Elena Scaltritti, CCO at Topsoe, said:“We’re on a pathway to decarbonize aviation and other hard-to-abate sectors, and this project is a big step in the right direction. Arcadia has made great strides in short time by reaching this milestone on their first project. This agreement emphasizes our combined commitment to a sustainable future in aviation fuel production and supports Topsoe’s ambition to be a leader in low carbon solutions.”

Helge Sachs, SVP of Sasol ecoFT, said:“This is a momentous occasion for us to offering the first G2LTMlicense, a technology which allows a pathway to accelerate the decarbonization of our industry, specifically the aviation and heavy transport industries. It is a culmination of many years of development and cooperation between two world class leading technology partners to be able to offer Arcadia and the market a combined Power-to-Liquid technology.”

**Topsoe and Sasol’s contribution**The technology support for Arcadia marks the first single point license between Topsoe and Sasol, where the two companies will deliver their proprietary technology (G2LTM), converting CO2and H2into eFuel for aviation.

The technology primarily differs from production of natural gas-based fuels in the feedstock and technology for synthesis gas production. In eFuels plants, the feedstock is carbon dioxide, water, and power. The water is converted into hydrogen by means of electrolysis and the synthesis gas is produced from carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

**About Arcadia eFuels**Arcadia eFuels is committed to build facilities to produce the world’s future fuels. These net-zero carbon fuels will allow the transportation sector, namely aviation and shipping, to use efuels directly, without changes to existing engines and infrastructure. Arcadia eFuels aims to produce eFuels around the world to help meet the aviation industry’s decarbonization goals.
