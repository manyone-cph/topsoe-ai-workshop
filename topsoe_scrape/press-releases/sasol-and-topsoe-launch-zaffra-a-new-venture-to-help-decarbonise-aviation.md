Sasol, the global chemicals and energy company, and Topsoe, leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, announced the successful launch of their joint venture, Zaffra. With its headquarters based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Zaffra is set to become a key player in the aviation industry, focusing on the development and delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Under the leadership of**Jan Toschka, the appointed CEO of Zaffra**, the company is positioned to make significant contributions to reducing carbon emissions in the aviation industry. With a global presence, Zaffra's unique combination of pioneering SAF technologies and operational excellence places it at the forefront of the industry's transformation.

Zaffra combines the extensive experience of Sasol in asset development, plant construction, and robust operating and technology expertise and Topsoe’s proven carbon emission reduction technologies.

**Jan Toschka remarked:**“Leading Zaffra in this crucial mission is my privilege. The growing demand for SAF will require multiple pathways and Zaffra is in a unique position to become a relevant player in this market. Backed by Sasol and Topsoe’s legacies, our offer combines leading technologies with decades of experience in building and running production assets. We recognize the differences in each opportunity. That’s why I am convinced there is tremendous growth potential for Zaffra, being agile and creative, whilst recognising it is essential to form partnerships and to collaborate with all stakeholders.”

Zaffra's establishment marks a significant step towards achieving a more sustainable future for aviation, aligned with global efforts to combat climate change and reduce carbon emissions.

**Fleetwood Grobler, President and CEO of Sasol commented:**“Sasol is thrilled to further our global sustainable aviation fuel ambition through Zaffra. Zaffra is built on decades of collaboration between Sasol and Topsoe”.

**Roeland Baan, CEO of Topsoe, expressed similar enthusiasm:**“We’re very pleased to reach this important milestone with our joint venture with Sasol. With aviation being responsible for 2-3% of global carbon emissions, Zaffra will create significant value for the aviation industry and society by bringing alternative fuels to the market that can help reduce these emissions.”
