# Topsoe chosen as technology provider for HOLBORN’s Hamburg renewable fuels refinery

*Published: August 14, 2024*

- ****Located in Hamburg, Germany, HOLBORN’s renewable fuels complex is expected to be operational in early 2027 and aims to produce 220,000 tons of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per year.
- Topsoe will deliver its HydroFlex™ technology, which enables the production of SAF and renewable diesel from waste and residue materials.
- The licensing agreement represents continued momentum in the global market for Topsoe’s technology to produce renewable fuels.

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, has signed an agreement with HOLBORN Europa Raffinerie GmbH (HOLBORN), to provide its HydroFlex™ technology for the production of SAF and renewable diesel at its plant in Hamburg.HOLBORN is a successful oil refinery that supplies Hamburg and northern Germany with fuels and heating oil.

The production will serve to address the rapidly growing demand for SAF. As cited by the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Scenario, over 10% of fuel consumption in aviation needs to be SAF by 2030 to stay on course for net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. In 2022, the International Air Transport Association estimated global SAF production to make up only around 0.1% to 0.15% of total jet fuel demand.

**Elena Scaltritti, Chief Commercial Officer at Topsoe, said:**“We are pleased to sign this agreement with HOLBORN. To support the energy transition, we need a cleaner long-distance transportation sector. A key step in securing this is by increasing production of SAF and renewable diesel. HOLBORN is spearheading the rollout of SAF in Northern Europe through its Hamburg plant, and we are proud to be a part of this process. We look forward to delivering our technology and continue working with HOLBORN to accelerate the uptake of SAF in Europe and globally.”

**Lars Bergmann, Chief Executive Officer at HOLBORN, said:**“Our complex in Hamburg is at the forefront of our commitment to implement the energy transition. As such, it is vital we bring in the best technology to deliver on the high standards and specifications required for the project. HOLBORN is very pleased to sign this agreement with Topsoe, who are proven market leaders, and whose technology is vital for processing our specific feedstock requirements.”HOLBORN develops the renewable fuels complex for Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) inside the existing refinery in Hamburg, Germany. The plant is expected to be operational in early 2027, including the interconnecting infrastructure with the existing facilities.

Once completed, the plant will produce approximately 220,000 tons per year of renewable diesel and SAF using waste and residue feedstocks.

This agreement with HOLBORN follows a number of wins announced by Topsoe for the roll-out of its HydroFlex™ technology, including Braya Renewable Fuels’ Come By Chance plant in Canada, Cepsa Bioenergia San Roque’s Palos de la Frontera plant in Spain, and Guangxi Hongkun Biomass in China.

**About HydroFlex™**With HydroFlex™, customers can convert various fats, oils and greases into drop-in renewable jet and diesel that meet all globally accepted specifications for these fuels. Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or fully renewable applications.
