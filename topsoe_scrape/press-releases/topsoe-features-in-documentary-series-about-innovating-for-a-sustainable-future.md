*Published: July 25, 2023*

- Topsoe features in documentary series -*Innovation and Disruption Leaders*
- In the documentary, Topsoe shares insights and progress on solutions to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy industry and transportation

As part of a documentary series called*Innovation and Disruption Leaders*, aimed at recognizing and celebrating industry's most innovative and disruptive leaders, Topsoe has shared insights and progress on solutions to decarbonize parts of society where direct electrification will not be an option for the foreseeable future.

The documentary will be featured on CBS News and other platforms from July 25thand is availablehere:*[Innovation and Disruption Leaders (CBS News)](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/decarbonizing-hard-to-abate-sectors-through-innovation/#x)*

Roeland Baan, CEO at Topsoe, said:“There is a critical need to scale up renewable energy and electrolysis, as well as ensure the right framework conditions and incentives are in place. We need radical change and leadership to drive the energy transition. With highly innovative technology, Topsoe is determined to solve the challenge of decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors.”

Heavy industry and transportation, also known as hard-to-abate sectors because they are difficult to electrify, are responsible for around one fourth of global greenhouse gas emissions. To decarbonize sectors such as aviation, there is a need for solutions to bridge the gap between renewable energy and the fuel tank of an airplane.

Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to cut aircraft CO2emissions by over 80%, and with eFuels made from renewable power it is close to 100%.

Elena Scaltritti, CCO at Topsoe said:“The solutions are already here and proven. The challenge is to scale and commercialize in order to accelerate and increase impact. For sustainable aviation fuel, this means we need greater effort to commercialize approved pathways, greenlight new pathways, and diversify used and permitted feedstocks.”

Topsoe is also striving to speed up the global hydrogen economy. The company is currently building the world’s first Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) manufacturing facility at industrial scale with the potential to revolutionize Power-to-X.

Sundus Ramli, CCO of Power-to-X at Topsoe, said:“Topsoe’s SOEC electrolyzer technology is up to 30% more efficient than competing electrolyzer technologies. More than 90% of the renewable electricity that enters the electrolyzer is preserved in the green hydrogen it produces. Meaning it has lower power consumption and higher output – making the most of the renewable power needed for the process and leaving minimal environmental footprint.”
