# SNOX™ sustainable emissions control technology enters the carbon black industry

*Published: April 11, 2018*

- *Orion Engineered Carbons LLC has signed a contract for Topsoe’s sustainable flue gas cleaning technology, SNOX™.**The contract has a value of a three digit million DKK amount.*
- *It is the first time that SNOX™ is applied in the carbon black industry.*

Since 2014, Orion has conducted in-depth analyses of the SNOX™ process, including investigative site visits to existing Topsoe plants and testing the concept at one of Orion’s manufacturing facilities.

In particular, Orion was convinced by the second-to-none sustainability profile of SNOX™, which does not consume any reagents, apart from ammonia for the NOx reduction, and does not consume any water. Other factors that played a major role in their selection were the highest available energy efficiency and the very low emissions level that meets the stringent environmental regulations.

The agreement with Orion includes engineering, license, proprietary equipment, spare parts, catalyst, and future supervision tasks during commissioning and start-up, as well as service obligations during commercial operation. The SNOX™ plant is scheduled to be in full commercial operation by April 2021.
