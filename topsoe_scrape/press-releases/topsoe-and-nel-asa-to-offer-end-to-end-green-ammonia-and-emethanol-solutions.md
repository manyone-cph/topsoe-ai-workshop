# Haldor Topsoe and Nel ASA to offer end-to-end green ammonia and eMethanol™ solutions

*Published: March 24, 2021*

- Haldor Topsoe and Nel have entered a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the intent to offer customers complete renewable electricity to ammonia and methanol solutions.
- Solutions will be based on globally leading technologies from the two companies; Nel’s alkaline and PEM electrolysis technologies in combination with proven ammonia and methanol technologies from Topsoe.
- Green ammonia and eMethanol™ are both considered promising low-carbon transportation fuels and energy carriers.

“We are very pleased to take the next step in our excellent relation with Nel. Together, we can offer end-to-end renewable electricity to ammonia and methanol solutions based on the most reliable technologies available today. Driven by our vision to be recognized as the global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies by 2024, we are excited to offer innovative and attractive low-carbon solutions to our customers. This cooperation speaks directly to our customers’ needs as we see massive interest from the market requesting basic engineering, license, and process guarantee in one package,” says Amy Hebert, Chief Commercial Officer of Haldor Topsoe.

Topsoe is currently engaged in several projects to produce green hydrogen, green ammonia, eMethanol™, and green fuels. An example is the Helios project in NEOM, Saudi Arabia, announced in July 2020, which includes the world’s largest ammonia loop (1.2 million tons per year) delivered by Topsoe.

“We are very excited to join forces with Haldor Topsoe, who offers world-leading ammonia and methanol technologies that can add tremendous value together with our electrolysis technologies. Our vision is all about ‘Empowering generations with clean energy forever’. We see much promise in adding the possibility of processing hydrogen into eMethanol™ and green ammonia which are widely regarded as important low-carbon fuels of the future,” says Jon André Løkke, CEO, Nel.

“Our collaboration with Nel is very promising. As partners, we are already looking into concrete projects based on our end-to-end solutions,” adds Fei Chen, Senior Vice President in Haldor Topsoe.

Under the MOU, Topsoe intends to supply license, engineering, proprietary hardware, catalyst and technical service for its ammonia and eMethanol™ technologies, as well as system integration engineering. Nel intends to supply its alkaline or PEM electrolysis technology and proprietary hardware, and subsystem engineering.
