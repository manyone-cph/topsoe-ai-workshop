# Topsoe to support first sustainable aviation fuel-production in Brazil

*Published: October 19, 2022*

- Brasil BioFuels willbuilda new biorefinery to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and second generation biofuel.
- Topsoe has beenselectedto support the production delivering its HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™ technologies.
- The new biorefinery will be built in Manaus, Brazil,and willhave a production capacity of 500 kTPY (kilo tones per year)The production is expected to start in 2025.

The Brazilian market offers great potential within low carbon fuels and Brasil BioFuels is one of the pioneers when it comes to SAF.

Gustavo Cienfuegos, Managing Director at Topsoe, Latin America, said:“We are thrilled to beselectedas technology provider by Brasil BioFuels for their ambitious plans of introducing SAF and second generation biofuels to the Brazilian market. We are excited to start working with Brasil BioFuels to deliver these clean fuels”.

Milton Steagall, CEO of Brasil BioFuels, said:"We are looking for the best and most innovative technologies so that our biorefinery, a pioneer in the country, will be a reference in sustainability and operational excellence."Brasil BioFuels is to build the first biorefinery in Brazil for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO). Topsoe’s hydroprocessing technology will allow the biorefinery to produce the low-carbon fuels while at the same time recycling gases and liquids from the process for production of hydrogen that will be integrated in the biorefinery’s operations.

**What is HydroFlex™ and H2bridgeTM**With HydroFlex™, customers can convert low value feedstocks into drop-in renewable jet and diesel that meets all of the globally accepted specifications for these fuels. The innovative HydroFlex™ process layout offers lower capital expenditure (CAPEX), but also a lower energy consumption during operation, resulting in a lower Carbon Index (CI). Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or stand-alone applications. HydroFlex™ is by far the most successful renewable fuels technology globally.

The H2bridge™ technology captures waste propane and carbon off gas from the refining process, converts it into hydrogen to be included in powering facility operations.****
