In addition, RNESL will invest GBP 25m in Faradion. As part of this transaction, Topsoe will divest its shareholding in Faradion, corresponding to c. 16% of the fully diluted share capitalat the date of completion.

Topsoe has been working with Faradion since 2013 and has in the same period been an active shareholder in the company. As a new owner, RNESL will work with Faradion on commercialization and setting up industrial scale manufacturing.
