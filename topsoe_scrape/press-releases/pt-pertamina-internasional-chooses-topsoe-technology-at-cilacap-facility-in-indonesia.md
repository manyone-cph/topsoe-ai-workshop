# PT Pertamina Internasional chooses Topsoe technology at Cilacap facility in Indonesia

*Published: September 18, 2023*

- Topsoe is selected technology provider at PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional’s (“PT KPI”) renewable fuels production units in Cilacap, Indonesia
- The Cilacap refinery plans to produce 6,000 bpsd (barrels/day) of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel.
- PT KPI is a sub-holding of PT Pertamina, a Fortune Global 500 company providing energy and developing new and renewable energy services, both upstream and downstream. Cilacap refinery is one of the integrated sites of PT KPI, which also houses a petrochemical complex.

Topsoe, a global leader in developing solutions for a decarbonized world, has been selected by PT KPI as a technology licensor to provide its HydroFlex™ technology for the production of renewable fuels at the Cilacap Refinery Complex in Central Java, Indonesia.

Once complete, the grassroot unit will use Topsoe’s technology to convert bio-feedstock into SAF and renewable diesel, with plans to produce 6,000 bpsd.

This milestone marks Topsoe’s 50thHydroFlex™ reference globally.

Alok Verma, Managing Director, Asia Pacific, Topsoe, said:“We are pleased to continue our close collaboration with Pertamina marking our 5thtechnology reference with the Group. This award at the Cilacap refinery is a key milestone for the supply of renewable fuels to the Asia market. It’s a tremendous pleasure working with Pertamina on these very successful projects taking the region towards carbon neutrality.”

**What are renewable fuels?**Renewable fuels are low-carbon fuels that are chemically identical to regular petroleum diesel or jet fuel but made from renewable sources. These renewable fuels produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions while performing the same as regular petroleum diesel or jet fuel. They can be used as a drop-in fuel without modification to engines or infrastructure. Renewable fuels are made from waste, animal fats, used cooking oils and organic materials such as soybean oils.

**What is HydroFlex™**With HydroFlex™, customers can convert low-value feedstocks into drop-in renewable jet and diesel that meet all globally accepted specifications for these fuels. The innovative HydroFlex™ process layout offers lower capital expenditure (CAPEX), but also a lower energy consumption during operation, resulting in a lower Carbon Index (CI). Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or full renewable applications. HydroFlex™ is by far the most successful renewable fuels technology globally.
