# Topsoe selected by World Energy GH2 to supply ammonia loop for Canada’s largest renewable hydrogen plant

*Published: August 7, 2023*

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, has signed an agreement with World Energy GH2solutions provider, to provide Topsoe’s dynamic ammonia loop technology for Canada’s largest, and one of the world’s first-to-market, renewable hydrogen projects - Project Nujio’qonik.

Located in the Bay St. George region of Newfoundland and Labrador, Project Nujio’qonik was announced by World Energy GH2in spring 2022 with an intended investment of USD $12 billion to produce renewable hydrogen, also referred to as green hydrogen, to decarbonize the hard-to-abate sectors globally. World Energy GH2will supply 250,000 metric tons of renewable hydrogen per year to global markets at the completion of its renewable hydrogen project. The project will use wind energy power for production on the site, which is expected to begin producing hydrogen in 2025.

Topsoe’s ammonia loop technology will be used to generate up to 1,650 metric tons per day of renewable ammonia on the site.

John Risley, Chairman of World Energy GH2, said:“Project Nujio’qonik is one of Canada’s first-to-market projects to produce hydrogen and ammonia at scale using renewable wind energy, and is a key cornerstone of the country’s agreement with Germany to stimulate hydrogen production by 2025. Following a rigorous analysis, we are pleased to have selected Topsoe’s proven technology for our project. Project Nujio’qonik will be instrumental in ensuring Newfoundland and Labrador takes its place as a preeminent global leader in the fight against climate change and becomes a catalyst for the development of other renewable hydrogen projects across Canada and across the world.”

Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director, the Americas, Topsoe, said:“We are very pleased to support World Energy GH2in one of the world’s first-to-market renewable hydrogen and ammonia production projects, highlighting our commitment to lead the development of the renewable hydrogen industry. The agreement is testament to the quality and depth of Topsoe’s ammonia production expertise and a huge sign of confidence in our world leading technology. We look forward to working with World Energy GH2to deliver on its targets for production in 2025.”

Renewable hydrogen and ammonia are under the Power-to-X umbrella, and a key enabler to make the energy transition happen.

Sundus Cordelia Ramli, CCO Power-to-X at Topsoe, said:“We need projects like Nujio’qonik. Large scale projects that can deliver the called for renewable fuels and chemicals to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors like steel, aviation and shipping. On a global scale, much more commercial-size plants are needed, but World Energy GH2project bears testimony to the fact, that it can be done.”
