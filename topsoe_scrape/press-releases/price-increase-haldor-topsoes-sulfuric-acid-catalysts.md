# Price increase for Haldor Topsoe’s sulfuric acid catalysts

*Published: August 11, 2021*

The increase is driven by a substantial increase in the price of vanadium, which is a necessary raw material for sulfuric acid catalysts.

The price adjustment will take effect immediately.

The VK sulfuric acid catalysts provide excellent activity over a wide range of operating conditions. This leads to unprecedented reductions in SO2emissions and make it easy to comply with stringent environmental regulation. VK catalysts also gives sulfuric acid producers the option to boost production volumes with no additional emissions.
