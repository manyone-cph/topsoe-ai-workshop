# Haldor Topsoe HydroFlex™ technology results in successful test run at Marathon Petroleum Corp. facility producing 100% renewable diesel

*Published: August 4, 2021*

- Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ technology has been used at the Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) renewable diesel facility in North Dakota, United States, exceeding all process guarantees.
- The new HydroFlex unit produces 100% renewable diesel from soy and corn oil with a combined capacity of 12,000 barrels per day.
- Topsoe’s HydroFlexTMtechnology enables clients to convert low-carbon renewable feedstocks into cleaner fuel alternatives.

“At Marathon Petroleum, we are meeting the needs of today while investing in a sustainable, energy-diverse future, and our renewable diesel production is a significant part of that commitment,” says Jeff Sexton, Marathon’s Refining Technology Director. “We’re excited about the success we’ve had with this technology at our Dickinson Renewable Diesel facility, which achieved its design capacity during the second quarter. We are looking forward to the conversion of our Martinez, California, refinery to renewable fuels production over the next year.”

“We want to thank Marathon for excellent collaboration during entire project execution of the Dickinson ND facility. As Marathon progresses plans for its Martinez Renewable Fuels facility and continues to evaluate other opportunities, we’re proud to contribute to this important endeavor,” says Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director, The Americas, Haldor Topsoe.

With HydroFlex™, customers can convert low value feedstocks to renewable fuels that qualify for the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard credit. The innovative HydroFlex™ process layout offers lower capital expenditure, and also lower energy consumption during operation, resulting in a lower carbon intensity. Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or stand-alone applications.
