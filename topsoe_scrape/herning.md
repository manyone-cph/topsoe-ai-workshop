Construction commenced in November 2022, and by the end of 2024, we're set to launch production of our next-generation electrolyzer technology. Topsoe SOEC stands poised as a vital catalyst in the renewable energy transition. By harnessing this technology, the green hydrogen it produces serves as a direct substitute for fossil fuels across various industries and processes. Additionally, it can be transformed into a versatile range of alternative e-fuels using through a process known as Power-to-X.

Topsoe is proud to have the support of the European Union on our journey to bring essential solutions to market, crucial for decarbonizing European industry and facilitating its transition to climate neutrality.

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, receives EUR 94 million from the EU Innovation Fund. The funding will help de-risk the construction of the 500 MW factory in Herning, Denmark. The factory is Topsoe’s single biggest investment to date and is scheduled to be operational by 2025.

The factory will produce advanced and energy-efficient Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cells (SOEC) needed to produce green hydrogen and its derivatives. Electrolyzers are key to decarbonizing energy-intensive industries and long-distance transport that cannot be easily electrified. Therefore, we can operate ships at sea and aeroplanes in the air with CO2-neutral fuels so that our climate impact will be much less than it is today.

In Europe alone, the EU Commission has announced a proposal to deploy 40 GW of electrolyzers produced in Europe by 2030.

The green hydrogen produced from the factory’s SOEC electrolyzers will reduce emissions by approximately 7.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent over the first ten years of operation when compared to hydrogen produced from natural gas.

- The Danish Environmental Agency grants Topsoe environmental permit for Topsoe’s Herning factory currently under construction.
- The factory will produce Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cells (SOEC) for the production of e-fuels.
- The factory is on schedule to be in operation by 2024.

Topsoe, a global leader in carbon emission reduction technologies, has reached a key milestone in the form of environmental permit from the Danish Environmental Agency.

The approval from the Danish Environmental Agency means, that Topsoe’s factory lives up to both Danish and EU environmental regulations and standards. This includes using the best available technical solutions, introduction of emission cleaning systems, proper waste management plans, high efficiency in use of power and water, and more. The environmental approval further allows the factory to enter into commissioning stage and powering up equipment.

Kim Hedegaard, CEO Power-to-X at Topsoe, said:“We are very satisfied with this stamp of approval from the Danish Environmental Agency. The factory, which will produce SOEC electrolysis units will mean a solid contribution to the green hydrogen economy, and this permit confirms that we’re on track building a factory adhering to all appropriate regulatory and sustainability standards.”

### **ELECTROLYSIS CAN ACCELERATE****THE GREEN TRANSITION**

Power-to-X can help decarbonize challenging sectors such as cement, chemicals, and steel, as well as heavy transport modes like ships, airplanes, and trucks. These sectors are deemed 'hard-to-abate' due to their substantial energy needs, making CO2 footprint reduction difficult.Green hydrogen produced through electrolysis serves as a CO2-neutral fuel and a key component for manufacturing climate-neutral fuels such as green ammonia, eMethanol, and CO2-neutral diesel and green chemicals, positioning hydrogen as a crucial player in the green transition.

#### WHAT IS POWER-TO-X?

Power-to-X uses electrolysis, converting electricity into hydrogen by splitting water molecules (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2).Electrolysis can produce different types of hydrogen with varying CO2 footprints. categorized by color: gray, brown, blue, pink, and green, depending on the energy source.We call it green hydrogen when it is generated through electrolysis using renewable energy. It is considered the fuel of the future because it can be transformed into CO2-neutral fuels, and applied in industries that are otherwise challenging to electrify, including heavy transport. The electrolysis technology from Herning will play a crucial role in the green transition, emphasizing the instrumental role of Power-to-X.

#### **WHAT IS ELECTROLYSIS TECHNOLOGY?**

With these ingredients, electrolysis can split water into oxygen and hydrogen, and the hydrogen can be used to produce green fuels for various purposes.The electrolysis technology consists of a cell where the electrolysis takes place. What is unique about our electrolysis technology is that we stack 100 cells in a structure called a stack to accommodate more cells. The core of the electrolysis technology—a kind of cylinder container—can hold 12 stacks.

There are three different types of electrolysis technologies: Alkaline, PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane), and SOEC (Solid-Oxide Electrolysis Cell). Our electrolysis is based on SOEC, which differs from the other technologies by using steam instead of liquid water for the electrolysis.

#### WHAT IS SOEC TECHNOLOGY?

SOEC technology is the most efficient electrolysis we have today, but historically, it has been less attractive commercially because the costs have been too high relative to capacity.Topsoe’s SOEC electrolysis technology is a modular design that leverages high-temperature electrolysis – a tested and proven process that enables industrial-scale production of green hydrogen using renewable electricity. Due to the nature of the high-temperature electrolysis, Topsoe’s SOEC technology is about 30 percent more energy-efficient compared to conventional electrolyzer technologies.Additionally, when coupled with waste heat-producing technologies (such as those used in ammonia, methanol, or steel production), SOEC allows for the lowest levelized hydrogen cost, no matter the industry.

“We’re excited that we have succeeded to attract this significant funding, as this is a clear recognition of our SOEC-technology being state-of-the-art. It’s a high-temperature technology capable of producing 30% more green hydrogen based on the same input of renewable power when compared to standard technologies. The factory is the first of hopefully many more of its kind, making us able to truly help decarbonize shipping, aviation, steel and many more industries."
