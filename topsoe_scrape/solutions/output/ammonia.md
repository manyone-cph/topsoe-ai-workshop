# Ammonia

Ammonia is a versatile chemical compound that has primarily been used as a fertilizer in agriculture to feed the world's growing population, as well as in the production of numerous other chemicals, such as plastics, pharmaceuticals, and explosives.

Ammonia as a low-carbon energy carrier is receiving significant attention. Its high-energy density makes it an attractive fuel source, and when produced through a sustainable production method (low-carbon or green ammonia), ammonia is considered a gamechanger in decarbonizing the maritime industry and other energy-intensive industries where direct electrification is not an option. This will create a need for larger-than-ever built capacities.

Being easy to store and transport, ammonia can be distributed worldwide by means of trucks, trains, ships, and pipelines. Ammonia is often discussed as the energy carrier and storage medium of the future and is considered an important transportation method for hydrogen.

Green ammonia (or eAmmonia) is produced by synthesizing green hydrogen (hydrogen produced through electrolysis and from a renewable electricity source) and nitrogen.HubSpot Call-to-Action Code[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif][](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/2115834/8270bf4a-4f5a-44d9-9ca8-32d918ca4010)end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code

Low-carbon ammonia (also known as 'blue ammonia') is a responsible way of producing ammonia. It uses natural gas as its feedstock and integrates carbon capture and storage to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.HubSpot Call-to-Action Code[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif][](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/2115834/d392a154-0286-47ac-9d07-e53f56f0bdc0)end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code

Producing conventional ammonia (also known as 'grey ammonia') at the lowest cost per ton is a challenge many face every day.
