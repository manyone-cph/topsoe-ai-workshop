# Hydrogen

Hydrogen is one of the most abundant elements on earth, and already plays a crucial role in today's energy landscape. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), hydrogen's use tripled from 1975 to 2018.The abundance of hydrogen coupled with its potential for sustainable methods of production, positions it as a promising solution in the global energy transition. Low-carbon hydrogen (also commonly referred to as ‘blue’ hydrogen) and green hydrogen offer essential pathways for rapidly decarbonizing energy-intensive sectors that cannot be directly electrified. These sectors include aviation, shipping, steel, cement, fertilizer, refining, and chemical production.On top of this, hydrogen is a crucial component in the production of  derivatives, such as ammonia and methanol.

We’ve optimized our wide range of hydrogen solutions to ensure the most reliable production. Our proven track record helps tp ensure the scalability and economic feasibility of your hydrogen project.

Green hydrogen is produced through electrolysis, using renewable electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. This process can pave the way for a completely renewable energy system.HubSpot Call-to-Action Code[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif][](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/2115834/cab1b3b2-7a0f-4152-8a1d-2f0cb1d024dc)end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code

Low-carbon hydrogen (also known as 'blue hydrogen') can be produced from hydrocarbon sources, commonly in he form of natural gas, in combination with carbon capture technology. The captured carbon is stored or utilized for industrial applications.[Blue hydrogen](/blue-hydrogen)

Conventional hydrogen (also known as 'grey hydrogen') can be produced from a wide range of alternative feedstocks including natural gas, coal, LPG, heavy naphtha, waste, and other biomaterials.[Conventional hydrogen production](/processes/hydrogen)

Hydrogen's essential role to play in our strive towards net-zero faces one barrier: it's production is not always co-located with demand and it's very difficult to store and transport. Ammonia is an ideal hydrogen carrier, ammonia cracking the technology needed to crack ammonia back into hydrogen and help secure out worldwide availability of hydrogen
