# Methanol

Methanol (CH3OH) has long been a key product within the chemical industry, used in the production of formaldehyde, acetic acid, and plastics. While its current applications have resulted in a methanol industry that produces 98 million tons per annum[1](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2021/Jan/IRENA_Innovation_Renewable_Methanol_2021.pdf?rev=ca7ec52e824041e8b20407ab2e6c7341), the energy transition is opening up new potential for this versatile chemical.

Methanol’s qualities – such as it’s ability to be clean-burning, readily biodegradable and easily stored, transported, and distributed in liquid form – have put it on the map as a new alternative fuel source, most notably for the shipping and automotive industries. With an increased focus on e-fuels being a key part of the drive towards net-zero, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) projects that methanol production could reach 500 million tons a year by 2050.[2](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2021/Jan/IRENA_Innovation_Renewable_Methanol_2021.pdf?rev=ca7ec52e824041e8b20407ab2e6c7341)

**Multiple pathways to methanol production across industries**

The ability to produce methanol from a vast spectrum of feedstocks – such as natural gas, coal, biomass, municipal waste, renewable energy, and CO2 – offers multiple pathways to methanol production for a wide variety of industries.

At Topsoe, we offer expertly engineered solutions to help you achieve optimal methanol production, regardless of what pathway you choose.

At Topsoe, we use the term “green methanol” to refer to any carbon-free methanol, including bio-methanol produced from waste streams. By contrast, “eMethanol” (sometimes written “e-Methanol” or abbreviated “eMeOH”) means methanol synthesized from green hydrogen and biogenic CO2.As a result of it’s renewable feedstocks, e-methanol emits 90 percent less CO2 than its fossil fuel-based counterpart.[3](https://www.methanol.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CARBON-FOOTPRINT-OF-METHANOL-PAPER_1-31-22.pdf,%20p.14)
