As oil and gas get harder and more expensive to process the industry is under pressure to squeeze the most value out of them while searching for viable alternatives. Our solutions are designed to handle all feedstocks and still ensure easy, reliable, stable and profitable hydrocracking and hydrotreating. Superior process designs, performance catalysts and proprietary equipment ensure significantly longer cycle length while increasing yield and plant availability, reducing energy consumption and CO2emissions. Our portfolio also includes a full range of solutions for emissions management and the efficient and reliable production of high quality hydrogen, ensuring our customers benefit from all potential synergies with minimum environmental impact.
