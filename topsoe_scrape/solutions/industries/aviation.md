# Aviation

The aviation industry stands face to face with the difficult challenge of decarbonizing while continuing to meet the rising global demands for air travel. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has long been recognized as a crucial solution for helping the industry decarbonize and, as we write this, is expected to reduce 65% of aviation emissions by 2050.

By leveraging our expertise and technologies, we are committed to supporting the aviation industry in its transition towards a more sustainable future. With feedstock flexibility and a range of proven technologies, we are here to help the industry ramp up the production of SAF.
