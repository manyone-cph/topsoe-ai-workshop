# Shale gas

While the shale gas industry may only be getting off the ground, there is no doubt that the opportunities are potentially unlimited. As with similar industries, we believe the greatest progress will result when local upgrading of feedstocks makes both economic and practical sense. Our solutions can enable well owners to convert or upgrade their gas to higher-value fuels and chemicals, including methanol and urea. This can help them move beyond just supplying gas to benefit more from the value they create, safely and profitably. Our expertise in shale gas processing ensures that our clients can capitalize on the full potential of this resource while maintaining operational efficiency and sustainability. By offering flexible and efficient solutions, we help businesses navigate the complexities of the shale gas industry and achieve long-term success.
