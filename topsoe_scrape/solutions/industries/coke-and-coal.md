# Coke & coal

Coal is an abundant natural resource with enormous potential to be converted into clean fuel and alternative feedstock for many chemicals. In recent years we have made quantum leaps in the upgrading of coal and processing of waste products from coke ovens into higher value products and cleaner energy. Our solutions not only make it feasible, but also economically attractive, to process these feedstocks directly at source into SNG, gasoline or other high value products rather than transporting them to be processed closer to market.
