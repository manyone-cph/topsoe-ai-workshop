# Automotive

In 2022, electric vehicles accounted for 21.6% of new car registration in the EU1. With the EU's aim for zero CO2 emissions from car by 2035, this trend will likely continue. As a result, the automotive industry will experience a surge in demand for rechargeable batteries, as well as a need for more sustainable and cost-effective materials for these batteries. Forward-thinking companies are now prioritizing the reduction of critical and hazardous materials while simultaneously bringing down cost and maintaining safe and powerful battery performance.

We have developed best-in-class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode active materials (CAM). LNMO fits into electric vehicle (EV) batteries and is optimized for low cost and high energy. It is suitable for demanding applications that require fast charging or discharging. LNMO delivers performance on par with state-of-the-art high nickel lithium-ion batteries but at a much lower cost and with significant environmental benefits in the supply chain.

A game-changing  approach to  stable cycling of  lnmo-graphite cells

The need for cost-effective and high-performance  energy storage solutions has been a driving force in  advancing battery technology. In this context, the  combination of a high-voltage cathode material,  like Lithium Nickel Manganese Oxide (LNMO)  with graphite as the anode, has emerged as an  exceptionally promising system for automotive  application.
