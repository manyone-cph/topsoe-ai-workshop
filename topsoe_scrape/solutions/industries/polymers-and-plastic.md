# Polymers & plastic

As demand continues to grow and traditional feedstock prices rise, the polymers and plastics industry is under increasing pressure to make more from less. Our broad range of solutions helps ensure the continuous, stable and energy efficient production of the high quality methanol, formaldehyde and other intermediates needed for profitable production. They can also enable the upgrading of shale gas, coal and bio resources as alternative feedstocks, as well as enable co-production flexibility so customers can adjust production optimally to market demands.
