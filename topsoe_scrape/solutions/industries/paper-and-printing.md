# Paper & printing

The paper industry is highly competitive and even the slightest changes in performance can have a huge impact on the bottom line.Â  In recent years we have been working hard to help the industry convert byproducts and waste into energy and other valuable products. Our emissions management solutions enable customers to meet legislation and convert sulfurous off-gases into valuable sulfuric acid. Our chemical processing solutions enable them to upgrade waste, including black liquor, into fuels and a broader range of valuable chemicals, in a cost-efficient way.
