# Hydrogen

Hydrogen is an essential element in a broad range of industrial, chemical and refining processes. As a result, the cost efficient and stable production of high purity hydrogen is vital to the profitability of many businesses. We can help make hydrogen from natural gas as well as a wide range of alternative feedstocks including coal, waste and other biomaterials. Our solutions, which can be tailor-made to allow feedstock flexibility, are optimized to ensure the most reliable production of high quality, high purity hydrogen, using the least amount of energy and other resources.
