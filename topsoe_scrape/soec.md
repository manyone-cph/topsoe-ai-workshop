# HIGH-PERFORMANCE ELECTROLYSIS

#### WHAT IS SOLID-OXIDE-ELECTROLYSIS (SOEC)?

There are three common industrial technologies for producing green hydrogen through electrolysis: high-temperature SOEC, low-temperature alkaline, and low-temperature proton exchange membrane (PEM).

Only SOEC uses water in the state of steam. The breakdown of the steam takes place within the SOEC cell, where it is split via reduction into a green hydrogen molecule and oxide ions (O2-). The oxide ions are then transported through the electrolyte to the anode and oxidized into oxygen molecules.

One significant benefit of choosing SOEC is its high efficiency compared to alternative technologies. This efficiency, achieved by leveraging high-temperature electrolysis, ultimately makes it possible to produce more hydrogen per unit of power.

#### SOEC: THE KEY TO REALIZING GREEN HYDROGEN POTENTIAL

SOEC technology plays a vital role in the sustainable production of green hydrogen. By utilizing renewable energy sources to power the electrolysis process, SOEC enables the efficient conversion of water into hydrogen and oxygen without harmful emissions.

This innovative technology not only enhances the efficiency of hydrogen production but also supports global efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transition to a cleaner energy future.

#### COMPARING SOEC TO INDUSTRY ALTERNATIVES

Our SOEC technology leverages high-temperature electrolysis, producing more hydrogen per unit of power compared to traditional alkaline and PEM methods.

This is achieved through faster reaction kinetics and optimized conductivity, resulting in higher efficiency and lower power consumption.

With our SOEC, renewable electricity is utilized optimally to produce green hydrogen efficiently. This results in more efficient and carbon-free processes for Power-to-X solutions.

#### CASE: INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY PROVIDER FOR FIRST AMMONIA

With Topsoe as its integrated technology provider, First Ammonia is constructing the world’s first commercial scale green ammonia plant using our SOEC technology. This means that First Ammonia can now harness the combined power of our SOEC electrolyzer and dynamic ammonia loop technologies to produce green ammonia. Based on the modular design of our SOEC plant, we bring ultimate flexibility and scalability, simpler maintenance and easy deployment. This landmark plant, based in Port Victoria, Texas, demonstrates the commercial viability of SOEC technology and modular green ammonia production at an industrial scale.

#### THE EU'S FIRST INDUSTRIAL-SCALE SOEC FACTORY

We are constructing the world’s first industrial-scale SOEC manufacturing facility in Herning, Denmark.

Set to begin operations in 2025, this 500 MW plant is backed by a EUR 94 million grant from the EU Innovation Fund, which vets the project and serves to mitigate potential risks in getting our SOEC technology to market.

The Herning facility will produce cutting-edge SOEC stacks, driving Europe’s green hydrogen goals and reducing CO2emissions by approximately 7.5 million tonnes over the next decade compared to conventional hydrogen production methods.
