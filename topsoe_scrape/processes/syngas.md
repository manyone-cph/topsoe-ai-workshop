### Syngas

High plant availability, energy efficiency and feedstock flexibility

Demand for methanol is driving producers to seek the greater yields and economies of scale that only larger plants can provide. As a result, 10,000 MTPD methanol plant layouts will likely soon be the new industry benchmark for large-scale production.

Topsoe-designed methanol production plants combine advanced syngas generation and syngas-to-methanol processes with high-activity methanol production catalysts and comprehensive services. They are designed specifically to help you maximize yields and drive down costs.

The methanol process descriptions below explain each of our methanol manufacturing processes. All of these processes are customized to meet the requirements of your individual methanol project.

## Applications within this area

A well-functioning purification of the feedstock to the syngas plant will have a great impact on the performance of downstream processes and their catalysts.

Our different reforming technologies are tailor made to meet the requirements of the customer without compromising on reliability.

In a syngas plant, the recovered CO2 can be recycled to the reformer section, hereby improving carbon efficiency, or sold as a by-product.

In some cases purification of the synthesis gas may be required to remove some of impurities like nitrogen species prior to sending the synthesis gas to the downstream synthesis unit.

Novel carrier catalyzing optimal performance

Safe and reliable operation of the syngas plant is key to any owner. A well-functioning steam methane reformer (SMR) can greatly impact the on-stream performance because it is one of the most complex unit operations in the plant.
