### Catalyst Poison Removal

Keeping Your Catalysts Active

The single most important factor for hydroprocessing unit profitability is the length of time your catalyst remains active. No matter how high a catalyst’s start-of-run activity is, if it deactivates more rapidly than expected, your unit performance will suffer and profits will drop.A major cause of premature catalyst deactivation is impurities in feedstocks. Nickel, vanadium, iron, silicon, arsenic, phosphorus, and sodium are often present in feedstocks at ppb or even ppm levels, and the effect on downstream catalysts can be devastating.Our expertise in contamination control, our market-leading poison guard catalysts, and our proven grading strategies minimize the effect of impurities in your feed blend and maximize profitability at your refinery.

## Applications within this area

Topsoe offers a number of highly efficient arsenic-trap catalysts that catch and accumulate arsenic many times more effectively than conventional hydrotreating catalysts.

Absorb any inorganic chlorine your feedstocks might contain and remove the threats to your ammonia and hydrogen plant productivity.

Topsoe offers a very comprehensive portfolio of guard catalysts that effectively trap nickel and vanadium before they reach your high-activity main catalyst.

Topsoe's proven hydrodemetallization (HDM) loading schemes will protect your reactor with the industry’s highest phosphorus uptake.

Developing catalysts with superior silicon capacity, Topsoe can help you tailor your loading scheme to guard against silicon and maximize cycle lengths.

Remove hydrogen sulfide and other sulfurous compounds at temperatures below 150°C (300°F) with Topsoe’s very high capacity sulfur guards.
