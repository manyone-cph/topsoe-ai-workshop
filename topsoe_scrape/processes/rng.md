### RNG

Maximum energy-efficiency and utilization of natural resources in the production of high quality, clean RNG

Profitable production of high quality, clean renewable natural gas demands the most energy-efficient process possible combined with a high utilization of natural resources. Our proven TREMP™ process, when integrated with our stable high temperature catalysts, is guaranteed to deliver optimal performance. For our customers this means they can produce more, higher quality, cleaner renewable natural gas from the same amount of natural resources, using less energy, while minimizing environmental impact.

## Applications within this area

In the gasification unit, a carbon-containing material such as biomass reacts with a controlled amount of oxygen and steam at high temperature.

In the gasification unit, a carbon-containing material such as biomass reacts with a controlled amount of oxygen and steam at high temperature.

In some process layouts, it is beneficial to reduce the amount of carbonyl sulfide (COS) before the process gas is sent to the Acid Gas Removal (AGR) unit.

In the Acid Gas Removal (AGR) unit, the majority of the sulfur compounds and the carbon dioxide are removed from the process gas.

In the feed purification process step, the final removal of sulfur in the form of hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide and other sulfur compounds takes place.

In the gas conditioning step, part of the carbon monoxide present in the process gas reacts with steam forming carbon dioxide and hydrogen while releasing heat.

In the RNG methanation process step, the final conversion of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen into the RNG product takes place.

If desired, it is possible to liquefy the RNG made via the Topsoe TREMP™ process to produce LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) for further distribution.
