### Sulfuric acid

Produce directly from spent acid, elemental sulfur or sulfur compound containing gases

Whether you produce sulfuric acid from elemental sulfur or from SO2 regenerate spent sulfuric acid or clean sulfurous gases, we have the optimal solution. Our high activity catalysts provide high conversion, high energy efficiency, low-pressure drop, production stability, as well as an exceptionally long life in any sulfuric acid plant. They ensure that our customers achieve higher production rates, improved heat recovery, fast start-up, optimal energy efficiency and the lowest possible SO2 emissions. Our Wet gas Sulfuric Acid (WSA) technology converts sulfurous gases to commercial-grade sulfuric acid without drying the gas, with a high energy efficiency and very low emissions.

## Technical service

Based on experience over more than half a century, Topsoe has established an extensive technical service programme available to our VK catalyst users. In addition to frequent contact, the service programme includes activity testing of catalyst samples, evaluations of catalyst performance, plant optimization, troubleshooting and management of catalyst replacement.Activity testing of catalyst samples represents a valuable source of information, which combined with data evaluations of the plant performance enables Topsoe to optimize future catalyst management.

## Applications within this area

Over the years Topsoe has brought major product breakthroughs to the market, providing the industry with new catalysts for more energy-efficient operation, lower SO2 emissions and higher production rates.

The WSA process is a wet gas catalytic process. The concentrated sulfuric acid is produced by condensation from a wet process gas. Drying of the process gas prior to treatment in a WSA plant therefore becomes superfluous, hence generation ...

Operating conditions, catalyst activity and equipment like  heat exchangers and the converters impact sulfuric acid plant  performance.

Tip the scales - get more from your sulfuric acid catalyst expenses with VK38+

Selecting the right catalysts for  a SO2 converter has always been  about balancing expenses and  gains. The new VK38+ helps create  that balance – and more.

COST-EFFECTIVE BOOST OF PLANT  PERFORMANCE  WITH NEW LEAP5™  CATALYSTS FOR SO2 OXIDATION

The profitability of sulfuric acid production is closely  related to the production rates achievable within SO2 emission limits. The optimal operating conditions of a  plant depend strongly on the plant configuration, catalyst  volumes and catalyst activities, and as SO2 emission limits  are tightened, more active sulfuric acid catalysts are  required to maintain the desired production rates.

New Improved dust protection catalyst

The introduction of the first dust protection catalyst,  VK38 in the shape of 20 mm rings in the 1970ies, provided  invaluable savings for sulphuric acid plants suffering  from pressure drop build-up as a result of dust present  in the feed gas. Industrial experience from more than  60 installations shows prolonged production campaigns  by minimum 50-75% and thereby, a reduction of time consuming and expensive shutdowns for catalyst screening  as well as significant savings in blower energy over time

Exploring a new catalytic solution for improving efficiency and energy balance in sulfuric acid plants

Understanding dynamics and emissions during sulfuric acid converter startup

Increased attention on emissions during startup of sulfuric  acid plants calls for better understanding of the dynamics of  the plants and the phenomena controlling the emissions of  SO2  and acid mist.

Dynamic simulations Sulfuric acid

Sulfuric acid plants often encounter transient phenomena such as emission spikes during unsteady operation. Emission spikes and related phenomena can be understood and predicted by considering the sulfur content of the V2O5-based catalyst used in sulfuric acid converters.

The profitable way to sulfuric acid

Profit margins are slim in the sulfuric acid business,  and plants that want to succeed need feedstock  flexibility, high conversion rates, low energy  consumption and high reliability. They also have to  meet increasingly strict limits on SO2 emission

High activity at low temperature

VK-7XX LEAP5™ is the latest catalyst  developed on the basis of the unique  LEAP5™ techology. It is optimized for  operation in converted strong gasses at  370-440°C/700-825oF, which is typical  for the final passes of single-absorption  plants

Troubleshoot, Monitor & Plan Ahead

Managing a sulfuric acid plant can be challenging  on the best of days, but what happens when real  trouble arises? Sudden changes in pressure drops or  emissions may force a decrease in production or even  a full shutdown for repairs. And even when everything  is working, catalyst activity changes over time – and  so should a plant’s operating conditions.

Guizhou Kailin sulfuric acid plants combat dust to eliminate unplanned downtime and improve Opex

The Guizhou Kailin Fertilizer company had two sulfuric acid plants in Guizhou, China that were experiencing similar problems. A severe pressure drop build-up over the first catalyst bed was increasing energy costs and eating away at margins. Dust was forcing the plant to shut down for unplanned screening maintenance and catalyst replacement.

Reduce SO2 emissions - Less than 100 PPM SO2 in the stack

In 1997, VK69 was installed in the fourth pass of a large 1460 MTPD sulphuric acid plant in Asia. The plant burns elemental sulphur and the four-bed converter has intermediate absorption after the third pass.

Yanggu Xiangguang copper takes new approach to meet emissions standards of 70 PMM SO2

The Chinese government has been tightening SO2 emissions regulations for years. In many regions, the targets are now set at 70 PPM. While some plants depend on conventional catalysts and scrubbers, Xiangguang Copper in Shandong Province wanted a long-term approach. the contacted Topsoe to find a catalyst solution to help them comply with stricter emission controls,

Nuova Solmine cuts SO2 emissions by 50%, complying with emissions regulations without reducing production

Nuova Solmine, a sulfuric acid plant in Scarlino, Italy, had been operating with SO2 emissions averaging about 280 PPM. When new regulations capped emissions at 224 PPM; the plant had to make a choice: reduce production of sulfuric acid, resulting in loss of profit, or find a way to reduce emissions without cutting production.

With Topsoe's Leap5™ catalyst, Australia's Incitec Pivot increased production & reduced emissions

Incitec Pivot's sulfuric acid at Mount Isa, Australia needed more sulfuric acid than they could produce, but transport of sulfur or sulfuric acid to the company's outback location was expensive.

Eliminate all risk of sulfur breakthroughs

Sulfur is the most common feedstock poison, and protection of downstream catalysts requires its removal to ppb levels. Hydrogenation to H2S and then absorption can remove much sulfur, but an effective guard like the ST-201 is often needed for complete purification.
