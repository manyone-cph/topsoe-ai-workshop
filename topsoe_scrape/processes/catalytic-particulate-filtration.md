### Catalytic Particulate Filtration

Combine particulate filtration with other systems to reduce complexity and total cost of ownership

In certain industries dust, soot and other particulates in off-gases are a problem that need special consideration. We enable our customers to combine particulate filtration with our other emission management systems, where the combination can reduce complexity and total cost of ownership. High efficiency filters combined with high activity catalysts ensure compliance with even the strictest regulations, in the most challenging environments.
