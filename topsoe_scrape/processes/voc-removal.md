### VOC Removal

Catalytic oxidation provides an affordable path to VOC compliance

Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are now regulated almost everywhere. And legislation is only going to get more stringent.

The question is how easily and affordably you can keep your operations compliant, with a reliable “license to operate”.

## Ways to remove VOCs

The traditional way to deal with VOCs from industrial processes is to superheat these carbon-based compounds to approx. 800–1100°C. This causes oxidation that breaks these pollutants down into clean, harmless vapor (usually water and carbon dioxide) and heat.However, thermal oxidization involves burning off large quantities of fossil fuels, and very little of the thermal energy can be recovered.

Instead of using expensive direct heat and high temperatures, catalytic oxidation systems rely on the chemical effectiveness of advanced catalytic activity to oxidize the pollutant concentrations and to remove these problematic substances from exhaust streams.Such catalyst-based processes mean oxidation removes 99+% of VOC pollutants at temperatures as low as 200–250°C, and with hardly any additional fuel costs.

The big advantages of catalytic oxidation technology lie in low operating costs, straightforward installation and easy operation.Topsoe CATOX™ solutions in this field provide a straightforward, reliable way to make VOC compliance affordable, so you can be sure of a “license to operate” – both now and in the future.

Getting this key capability in place quickly and affordably helps you get ahead of your competition – and stay there.To do that, our experts draw on an unparalleled process data and practical experience with catalytic oxidation of VOCs using different catalysts under different operating conditions.Our comprehensive end-to-end know-how makes it possible to identify and install the engineering setup that’s best suited to your particular operating requirements and CAPEX/OPEX constraints, and the most effective specialist catalysts for making sure your oxidation processes run cost-effectively and reliably.This unusual combination of capabilities provides big payoffs:

- Low CAPEX costs, because lower operating temperatures mean normal carbon steel can be used
- Low fuel consumption and OPEX
- "Complete system" supplier advantage, with well-integrated, no-surprises solutions
- Rapid startup and flexible operation that enable you to deal with changing requirements
- Automatic, round-the-clock operation
- Lower carbon dioxide emissions
- No secondary pollutants to deal with
