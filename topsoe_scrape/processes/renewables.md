They can be converted to biofuels in many different ways, with a wide range of feedstocks. Because of this diversity, unit design is crucial – as is selecting and loading the right catalysts.

Today, most countries have restrictions on how much biodiesel can be blended into diesel, since the properties of fossil and biodiesel are not identical.In the US, RFS2 (Renewable Fuel Standard 2) requires refineries to blend 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel into the country's total transportation fuels consumption by 2022. In Europe, RED (Renewable Energy Directive) requires all EU countries to ensure that at least 10% of their transport fuels come from renewable fuel sources by 2020. This has led many refiners to revamp their biodiesel production plants and use processes like our[**HydroFlex™**](https://www.topsoe.com/products/process-licensing/hydroflextm-technology?hsLang=en)solution.Although legislation concerning renewable feedstock is relatively recent, we are ready to help you meet demands for modern, high-grade biofuels today. With HydroFlex™ technology, renewable and non-renewable feedstocks thrive alongside each other. You can leverage our know-how to produce renewable fuels, future-proof your refinery and grow your business.

Hydroprocessing of renewable feedstocks - challenges and solutions

For processing renewable feedstocks, Topsoe's solutions provide full feedstock flexibility, enabling refineries to produce clean fuels from a wide range of feeds

The Fuel for Thought Podcast

The Fuel for Thought Podcast is the world’s first podcast about renewables for the refinery industry. Each episode features a conversation with an industry expert covering topics including the future of the industry, the impact of legislation, emerging technologies and market trends.

Renewable feedstock analyses: Critical need for reproducibility improvements

Throughout the regions, many ambitious targets have been set to increase renewable energy use within the transport sector. As increasingly stringent legislation looks likely to be implemented, growth within renewable energy in transport is expected to be significant.

Fueling the future with waste

Understanding  the complexity behind advanced biofuels is  not simple, as a wide range of considerations should be carefully understood when embarking on this journey.

The art of dewaxing, while maximizing yields

Yield is everything, and the world is turning to  renewable fuels, with all the challenges that entails.  Renewable feedstocks are all different, but one  thing they have in common is that dewaxing is  required.

Setting the stage for a high-value market

Knowing how to alleviate the effects of phosphorus contaminants when hydroprocessing renewable feedstocks is key.

ClearView renewables

ClearView™ renewables is a connected service that delivers closer  collaboration between your unit, its personnel, and Topsoe’s experts to  enhance the overall performance of your renewables unit.

From ambition to action

The global energy transition is in full swing. But we must not think the work is over. On the  contrary. Now is the time to work harder to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and  fully realize the goals of a net-zero world. Further industry, transport, and infrastructure  decarbonization is needed, and energy must be produced more sustainably.

Electrified steam methane reforming of biogas for sustainable syngas  manufacturing and next-generation of plant design: A pilot plant study

Electrification of the traditional steam methane reforming (SMR) technology for syngas manufacturing has a  significant CO2 reduction potential and make it more feasible to operate in combination with carbon capture/  utilization, especially if renewable electricity is used. This pilot plant study demonstrates the first operational  experience with industrial-scale electrified steam methane reforming (eSMR) technology using biogas as sustainable carbon feedstock

Higher yields, better cold flow properties - The answer is TK-930 D-Wax™

For years, refiners have been looking at incorporating dewaxing in ULSD services to process more barrels by increasing the feed endpoint in existing hydrotreaters. The problem with conventional dewaxing catalysts is their significant cracking functionality, causing some of the extra processed barrels to the lost to naphtha and light ends.

Fast-track your renewable journey with co-processing

Take the first and simple step on your renewable fuels journey by co-processing renewable feedstock in your existing kerosene or diesel hydrotreater or in your hydrocracker
