### Dimethyl ether

Maximize the economic potential of your dimethyl ether plant

Maximizing the economic potential of a dimethyl ether plant requires that all types of methanol can be processed optimally. We enable this for our customers by designing processes and catalysts that can operate with higher activity, selectivity, temperature and feedstock flexibility. Our integrated solutions also enable the production of high purity methanol, which allows customers to adjust production to market demands, ensuring they keep their bottom line healthy in a fluctuating market.

## Applications within this area

Having a well-functioning dimethyl ether purification of the feedstock will impact the performance of downstream processes and their catalysts and it will contribute to a high on-stream factor of the facility.

An efficient and reliable conversion of the feedstock has a huge impact on the economics of the plant.

Our methanol process is individually tailored to our customer needs based on capacity and feedstock requirements.

Topsoeâ€™s dimethyl ether (DME) technology and catalyst are designed to create a cost-efficient and end-product flexible production, with high product quality and low energy consumption.
