### Hydrocracking

High-quality products from low-value streams

Today, refineries have to produce more high-quality transportation fuels from heavier streams, while also improving profit margins. Our single-source supply of all the key elements of a hydrocracking unit comprising hydrocracker pretreatment, hydrocracking and grading catalysts, technology licensing including heavy poly-nuclear aromatic (HPNA) management solutions and high-performance reactor internals can help you maximize yields of the exact products you need – whether you process feeds, ranging from distillate to deasphalted oil (DAO), fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) slurry, and heavy coker gasoil – or[shale oil](/processes/unconventional-feeds),[coal tar](/processes/unconventional-feeds),[Fischer Tropsch wax](/processes/unconventional-feeds), and other[unconventional feeds](/processes/unconventional-feeds).

Topsoe solutions enable you to achieve better yield, greater efficiency, lower operating costs, reduced environmental impacts, and higher on-stream factor, as well as boosting your flexibility with regard to feedstocks, output, and to meet new market opportunities. Hence, our hydrocracking portfolio also fully supports new energy-transition applications, including[HydroFlex™](/our-resources/knowledge/our-products/process-licensing/hydroflextm-technology)and[PureStep™](/circular-plastic).We provide the know-how, technologies, and equipment to help you achieve the “balance of opportunities” that is best for you in volatile, unpredictable market conditions which require you to react quickly to make the most of commercial opportunities.

## Applications within this area

A profound understanding of catalyst kinetics and hydrocracking processes enables Topsoe to provide hydrocracking units that meet any market need – meeting all the requirements.

Proprietary BRIM® and HyBRIM™ technologies enable Topsoe’s hydrocracker feed pretreatment catalysts to deliver unmatched high activity for HDS and, in particular, HDN.

The hydrocracker is one of the most proﬁtable units in your refinery. Even unconverted oil from your hydrocracker can serve as a high-quality feedstock for lube oil plants, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units or steam crackers.

As you plan your transition into the renewable era, it’s important to effectively identify and leverage the production units that best align with your co-processing goals, and to determine the impact that renewable processing will have on ...

Higher activity, larger volume swell - The answer is HyBRIM™

Despite tremendous improvements within the catalyst technology in the past 20-30 years, ultra-low sulfur fuel legislation and the shift towards VGO hydrocracking to maximize diesel production are more than ever forcing refiners to search for the absolute top tier NiMo catalyst for their ULSD or hydrocracker pretreat reactor

New solution to HPNA management in hydrocrackers

All recycle hydrocracking processes are subject to adverse effects  caused by the formation of Heavy Poly-Nuclear Aromatic (HPNA)  compounds. HPNA’s are high molecular weight condensed aromatic  molecules containing greater than 7 benzene rings and boiling  above 500°C.

Refinery improves diesel cloud point by switching to Topsoe's catalysts

n today’s market, there is a significant economic incentive for  refiners to increase the size of valuable middle distillate product pool. Meeting cold flow properties is often a concern, especially  in colder climates where stricter winter specifications for ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) are enforced.
