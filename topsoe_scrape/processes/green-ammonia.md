# GREEN AMMONIA SOLUTIONS

*Published: November 17, 2023*

#### Green ammoniais the future

As a multipurpose, low carbon product that is increasingly being seen as gamechanger in decarbonizing shipping, agriculture and several other key industries, green ammonia is showing all the signs of exponential market growth. In fact, one recent analysis sees green ammonia accounting for some 300 mtpy, or two-thirds of all ammonia production by 2050, driven primarily by demand for green marine fuels and ammonia as an H2carrier1.To meet this projected demand and further the green energy transition, it is vital that green ammonia production proves to be sustainable and profitable – and this all comes down to the quality of your ammonia loop.By maintaining outstanding performance throughout its lifecycle, the right ammonia loop can overcome the complexity involved in synthesizing ammonia from CO2and green hydrogen, and become the backbone of a profitable green ammonia plant. This is why your choice of ammonia partner is critical for success.With nearly a century of leadership in ammonia production, Topsoe has the knowledge, experience and solutions it takes to succeed with green ammonia.

#### Ammonia plantsthe world trusts

Topsoe is the global leader in ammonia plant technology. We’ve been supplying ammonia solutions for over 80 years, and roughly half of all ammonia produced outside the PRC today is synthesized in a Topsoe loop.Built around our proven S-series ammonia converter, Topsoe ammonia loops ensure maximum efﬁciency and reliability via a straightforward, energy-efﬁcient process.A major advantage with Topsoe is that we also supply the catalyst, carefully engineering the symbiosis between converter and catalyst to unleash efﬁciencies that can’t be had otherwise.Topsoe supplies plants as conventional “stick-built” solutions or as our revolutionary ModuLite™ system, a prefabricated, truckable plant for capacities up to 600 MTPD.Our extensive lifecycle services make sure the plants we deliver keep living up to their full potential.

#### Why “green ammonia”?

Carbon-free fuels and other chemicals are still an emerging technology. Because of this, the terminology used to denote various products is still in flux. While the term “eAmmonia” (or similar) could be used to denote ammonia produced by synthesizing green hydrogen and nitrogen, Topsoe follows dominant industry practice in calling this product “green ammonia.”

#### Made to withstandfeedstock fluctuations

The electrolyzers that produce green hydrogen feedstock are powered by renewable energy. This means that feedstock supplies are intermittent and often limited for extended periods.With a traditional ammonia synthesis loop, safe, efficient and reliable operation requires a fairly stable supply of feedstock to the ammonia loop. Fluctuations in supply can force a plant into an emergency stop, which disrupts production, requires time-consuming restarts, and can lead to equipment fatigue that will shorten the plant’s lifetime.Topsoe’s green ammonia loop can dynamically adjust its load by 3% per minute and operate reliably over sustained periods with loads as low as 10% of nameplate capacity. This dynamic flexibility results in greater uptime, a longer service life, and less need for costly storage solutions for reserve supplies of green hydrogen or renewable power.

#### S-300 Converter:The beating heart ofa Topsoe ammonia loop

Built on decades of ammonia leadership and with over 50 installations worldwide, Topsoe’s S-300 radial ﬂow ammonia converter is the beating heart of a Topsoe ammonia loop.The converter’s three catalyst beds with radial flow allow for higher conversion rates using small catalyst particles. This results in higher overall catalyst activity, meaning greater overall efﬁciency and higher proﬁt margins.Advantages for green ammonia production include the ability to ramp up and down with ﬂuctuating feedstock loads, as well as sustained reliable operation at loads down to 10% of nameplate capacity.

#### KM1: Thebenchmarkfor ammoniaproduction

Topsoe’s KM1 ammonia synthesis catalyst is used in over half the world’s ammonia converters, with more than 1,200 charges supplied over the years.The KM1 features carefully selected promoters that ensure high and stable activity, resulting in a very long lifetime and record production rates. Typically, the KM1 is only replaced during plant revamps or when new converter internals are installed.For even better performance, the KM1 is often installed in the top converter bed, with Topsoe’s magnetite-based KM 111 installed in the lower beds, where ammonia concentrations are higher.

With catalysts supplied by Topsoe, you can:

- Maximize your plant’s design efficiency and sustain its performance
- Minimize supply-chain risks with catalysts developed using non-exotic materials
- Enjoy comprehensive support based on out eight decades of ammonia-industry experience

#### Pick yourplant type

Green ammonia can be put to many uses, from vessel and aviation fuel to fertilizer. To make sure we can meet any green ammonia production needs, we offer classic stick-built options, designed to the client’s capacity speciﬁcations, plus our revolutionary Topsoe ModuLite plant.Limited in capacity to 600 MTPD, ModuLite plants are unlimited in simplicity and ease of deployment. These prefabricated and truckable systems also offer the unique advantage that they can be delivered faster than traditional solutions, keeping time to market very short.Stick-built or ModuLite, all Topsoe green ammonia plants safeguard project margins via superior efﬁciency and a long lifetime of unmatched performance.

**PLANT TYPE 1**

#### Stick builtfor maximumcapacity

Projects needing to produce higher volumes of green ammonia should consider a stick-built plant. These plants offer capacities between 600 and 5000 MTPD, depending on the client’s needs.Our stick-built plants are responsible for about half the world’s current ammonia production, with some 200 currently in operation worldwide.Topsoe’s stick-built green ammonia production plants deliver superior efﬁciency and long-lasting high performance.

**PLANT TYPE 2**

#### ModuLite™ GreenAmmonia for shortertime to market

Ideal for facilities requiring capacities up to 600 MTPD, a Topsoe ModuLite Green Ammonia plant is supplied as prefabricated, truckable modules. The beneﬁts of a ModuLite plant include rapid deployment, a plug-and-play architecture, and less work on site – all of which gets production and revenue ﬂowing sooner.ModuLite plants are modular solutions in the sense that each plant comprises a number of prefabricated modules, plus the ammonia converter. Every plant is designed to meet speciﬁc green ammonia production volume requirements, and the ModuLite Green Ammonia plant is available in 300 and 600 MTPD versions.Although the ModuLite name is new, Topsoe has been working with and perfecting our modular concept for decades, giving you a green ammonia solution that is tried, tested and mature.

#### The green ammoniaecosystem

**Topsoe’s green ammonia production loops are part of an end-to-end solution that can also include our revolutionary SOEC electrolyzers for producing green hydrogen and our H2Retake™ cracking solution for converting green ammonia back into green hydrogen.**

Based on abundant, non-noble materials, our proprietary high-temperature SOEC electrolyzers produce green hydrogen 20–30% more efﬁciently than alkaline and PEM technologies. Other benefits include longer runtimes and higher output, quicker restarts and rapid-response ramping, and optimal renewable-power and electrolyzer-section sizing.SOEC can even electrolyze CO2to generate CO for use in eJet and other eFuels.

Topsoe’s ModuLite green ammonia plant is intended speciﬁcally for PtX applications. Designed for fast delivery and commissioning, the prefabricated and renewables-optimized plant ensures maximum efﬁciency and performance over a longer period of time, resulting in higher proﬁts.

Accommodating an ammonia feed range of 100–3400 MTPD, Topsoe's high-efﬁciency[H2Retake™](/our-resources/knowledge/our-products/process-licensing/h2retake-process)ammonia cracking solution produces zero-carbon green hydrogen at up to 99.9999% purity for use in a wide range of applications.[](http://dr.dk)
