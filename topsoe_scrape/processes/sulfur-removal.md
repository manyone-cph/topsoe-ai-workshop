### Sulfur Removal

Protect you profit with our Smarter Sulfur Solutions

Our Smarter Sulfur Solutions give you the know-how, technology, and services you need to keep your operation compliant and running smoothly. Each solution is optimized for a cost-effective lifecycle to protect your profit.

Our solutions are already in place in several industries, including oil refining and natural gas, viscose, pulp and paper, metallurgy, and carbon black.

**Smarter Sulfur Solutions can help you:**

- Deal with sulfurous off gasses and waste streams
- Reduce emissions
- Recover sulfur as sulfuric acid
- Improve efficiency
- Lower environment impact

No matter the industry, planning  requires forward-thinking that takes both compliance and profitability into consideration. Our solutions give you the crystal ball needed to deal with sulfurous emissions effectively and efficiently.

## Smarter Sulfur Solutions solve your industry's challenges

**Oil refining and natural gas**

- **Convert sour off-gases**into valuable sulfuric acid or elemental sulfur
- **Regenerate alkylation spent acid**via a waste-free, energy efficient process
- **remove harmful pollutants from flue gas**without consuming limestone or generation waste materials

**Pulp and viscose production**

- **Recover sulfur from sulfurous off-gases**such as CNCG, lean gases, and H2S-rich gases, as sulfuric acid for reuse within the site or plant
- **Increase sulfuric acid production**by adding molten sulfur to meet the plant's consumption
- **Minimize chemical import**to the plant through efficient recovery or recycling

**Metallurgy**

- **Convert SO2 off-gases into sulfuric acid**for reuse or a new revenue stream
- **Gain a reliable solution for SO2 emissions control**to meet requirements and reduce the risk of environmental damage
- **Treat fluctuating SO2 off-gases**at high and low SO2 concentrations reliably

**Carbon black**

- **Minimize SO2 emissions**while producing sulfuric acid as a new revenue stream
- **Handle****Particulate matter emissions**in a reliable unit for reduced environmental impact
- **Increase plant efficiency**through improved heat recovery

Topsoe offers a full range of solutions for dealing with sulfur emissions. When you partner with us, you gain access to a comprehensive range of technical services and innovative solutions that are designed to comply with increasingly stringent emissions standards. We also deliver licensing, basic engineering, and connected analytics services – and we offer the industry’s most extensive and advanced range of catalysts.

## What we deliver

## Applications within this area

Sulfuric acid production - sulfur emissions standards are constantly tightening, forcing industrial, chemical, refining, and metallurgical operations to find ways to comply with legislation and maintain profitability.

Turn your challenges into opportunities today by partnering with Topsoe and taking advantage of our know-how, technology, and services for spent acid regeneration.

Sulfur recovery solutions are a vital part of the picture when it comes to making the most of wasted sulfur compounds.

Topsoe’s flue gas treatment solution, SNOX™, helps you overcome FGD’s common challenges by recovering sulfur as commercial-grade sulfuric acid, instead of as gypsum.

Treatment of sulfurous off-gasses - maximizing sulfur recovery from off-gasses is vital for today’s oil and gas industry.

SweetPlus™ - monetize sour fuel gasses through sweetening

Turn waste into profit with   SweetPlus™ technology, a process  that lets you monetize otherwise  hard-to-utilize sour fuel gas by   converting it into pure fuel.

SmartSAR™ - regenerate spent acid with maximum energy recovery

SmartSAR™ is a cost-effective, and well-proven spent sulfuric acid regeneration technology that has been successfully applied to more than 20 alkylation units worldwide and a handful of other plants generating spent acid.

SNOX™ - reduce your costs for flue gas emission compliance

Low cost and effective flue gas  emission control used to be a   contradiction, but with our reliable  and efficient SNOX™ technology,  you can significantly reduce the  cost of staying compliant without   generating any waste.

SNOX™ for carbon black - reduce your costs for air quality control

With our SNOX™ technology, carbon black producers can significantly reduce the cost of staying compliant without generating waste. It even goes one step further by eliminating any related dust nuisance, placing stack emissions well below allowable levels.
