## SynCOR Ammonia™

Our[SynCOR Ammonia™](https://www.topsoe.com/products/syncor-ammoniatm-new-process-grassroots-plants)plant concept offers the ammonia industry an opportunity to produce ammonia in a smarter, safer and more profitable way – with significantly reduced environmental impact.[SynCOR Ammonia™](https://www.topsoe.com/products/syncor-ammoniatm-new-process-grassroots-plants)utilizes stand-alone autothermal reforming for the production of syngas instead of conventional tubular reforming. The technology brings significant benefits in large-scale applications, most notably an extremely low steam-to-carbon ratio of 0.6 and potential for single-train capacities exceeding 6,000 MTPD. This enables ammonia and urea producers to gain unprecedented economy of scale that cannot be achieved with conventional technology.[You can read more about SynCOR Ammonia™ here.](https://www.topsoe.com/products/syncor-ammoniatm-new-process-grassroots-plants)

When market opportunities or challenges call for product diversification, you’d want as a plant owner to be looking at integrated process solutions that can give you the flexibility you need to get ahead and stay there. Diversifying your product mix is an important strategic decision to gain added value, no matter if you are a new or an existing producer.

Plant owners who require flexibility benefit from our integrated process designs that can produce multiple end products. Depending on the quantities and flexibility required, we offer the[IMAP™ portfolio of solutions (Integrated Methanol and Ammonia Production)](https://www.topsoe.com/processes/ammonia/co-production)or the[SynCOR Plus™ solution](https://www.topsoe.com/products/syncor-plustm).

Our integrated process solutions enable any facility to produce multiple products without the often prohibitive cost of installing and operating a second plant, and they give you unprecedented agility, protection from market fluctuations and profit-making potential.[Read more about our co-production portfolio here.](https://www.topsoe.com/processes/ammonia/co-production)

## Integrated processes and multiple end products

## Applications within this area

Having a well-functioning purification of the feedstock to the ammonia plant will have a great impact on the performance of downstream processes and their catalysts and it will contribute to a high on-stream factor of the facility.

Our different reforming layouts can be tailor-made to meet the requirements of the client without compromising on reliability.

Efficient CO conversion plays an important role in the operating cost of the ammonia plant.

A well-functioning methanation section is vital for the optimal operation of the downstream synthesis section.

More than 65 years of experience with ammonia synthesis enables us to provide the best solutions for the ammonia industry.

Topsoe’s solutions for N2O abatement will save you money on CO2 permit units, will eliminate the need to invest in more units and generate revenues when you sell your units.

Give them what they want - for co-production within ammonia. Topsoe's integrated methanol and ammonia process (IMAP™) gives you the flexibility you need to get ahead and

Topsoe licenses CO2 recovery technologies from reputed suppliers and integrates them into our plant design in the most optimal way to ensure a reliable and cost-effective operation of the plant.

Delivering optimal performance - Ammonia catalysts

Complete portfolio of catalysts for ammonia production.

New SynCOR Ammonia™ process

Until now, large-scale ammonia production in single line configuration has suffered from a lack of demonstrated plant concepts with proven feasibility and competitiveness and traditionally, the industry has perceived 3,500 MTPD as the limit in single line capacity.

Increase safety by using an automated protection system to avoid over-firing of primary reformer

In early 2015, when Profertil was performing a hot restart of their ammonia plant, an uncontrolled and rapid increase in flue gas temperature was noticed in the primary reformer.

Ammonfuel - An industrial view of ammonia as a marine fuel

In August 2020, Alfa Laval, Hafnia, Topsoe, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa issued the report “Ammonfuel – an industrial view of ammonia as a marine fuel” based on own industrial expertise and input from a list of competent industrial players.

Cutting-edge solutions for ammonia plant revamps

Cutting-edge solutions for ammonia plant revamps

Relieve your process air compressor and save energy

The low restriction on the process air obtained with the patented FreeBurn™ for secondary reformers will increase your ammonia production, if the process air capacity is a bottleneck. Alternatively, maintain the ammonia production and yield compression energy savings in your process air compressor.

NEW FE-CR-FREE  FORMULATION FOR  HTS CATALYSTS  IS INDUSTRIALLY PROVEN

SK-501 Flex™ is an industrially proven high temperature shift catalyst which can  operate at virtually any steam-to-carbon ratio and at the same time does not contain  hazardous chromium compounds, eliminating associated risks to personnel health  and safety, having low environmental impact, and complying with increasingly strict  regulations.

Making more with less

COMPLETE  INTEGRATED  SOLUTIONS FOR  AMMONIA SYNTHESIS  CONVERSION

Proven formulas for seizing new opportunities

Imagine a plant that could deliver what the market  wants most, whenever the market wants it. No more  being locked in to a single product, with its ups  and downs. No more missing out on opportunities  to meet needs outside your main product. And no  more having to build two plants to make more than  just ammonia or just methanol.

Topsoe's priority service & supply helps KAFCO meet new government restrictions

Bangladesh's leading ammonia producer, Karnaphuli Fertilizer  Company Limited (KAFCO), was facing government–imposed  restrictions on natural gas supply, and needed to make sure they  were producing as much ammonia and urea as possible when gas  supplies were limited and when operating at reduced load.

Troubleshooting helps Trinidad ammonia plant save LTS catalyst

Just before Christmas, the inlet temperature on a low  temperature shift (LTS) converter at an ammonia plant in Trinidad  started falling. When the temperature dropped below the dew  point, operators shut down the plant and realized that water  could be drained from the bottom of the converter.

[Re]Route to better energy

Climate change is one of humanity’s biggest challenges, and the planet's demand for  low-carbon, high-purity energy products is at an all-time high. Hydrogen is often referred  to as ‘the fuel of the future' and is expected to play an important role in our strive towards  net zero.

Ammonia production at scale with the lowest carbon intensity

Discover how Topsoe’s SynCOR™ ATR and Honeywell UOP’s CO2 capture technology combine to create a high-efficiency, low-carbon hydrogen solution.

Catalysing the energy transition

Acritical part of confronting the need to  combat climate change is the  decarbonisation of industrial processes.  Hard-to-abate industries, characterised by  their substantial carbon footprints and intricate  production processes, stand as some of the trickier  challenges on the road to achieving net zero emissions.
