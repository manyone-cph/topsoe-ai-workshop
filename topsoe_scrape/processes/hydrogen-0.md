### Hydrogen

Reliable production from different feedstocks in the most cost-efficient way

Hydrogen is an essential element in a broad range of industries, such as chemical, refining, and steel. As a result, the cost-efficient and stable production of high purity hydrogen are vital to the profitability of many businesses. Topsoe processes produce hydrogen from natural gas as well as a wide range of alternative feedstocks including coal, LPG, heavy naphtha, waste, and other biomaterials. Our solutions can be tailor-made to allow feedstock flexibility and are optimized to ensure the most reliable production of the highest purity hydrogen, using the least amount of energy and other resources.

## Cost-efficient solutions

- We have developed an[integrated hydrogen process H2bridgeTM](/our-resources/knowledge/our-products/process-licensing/h2bridgetm-technology), specifically tailored for the renewables hydrocarbon feedstocks market.
- For small to medium size capacity hydrogen plants we offer our highly efficient[HTCR convection reforming technology](/products/equipment/convection-reformer-htcr), which is cost-competitive due to its modular design.
- For medium to large size capacity plants, we offer our high-efficiency[steam methane reforming process](/products/equipment/tubular-radiant-wall-steam-reformer?hsLang=en). This process can be combined with our[Heat Exchange reforming process](/products/equipment/heat-exchange-reformer-hter)to either increase its maximum size or optimize steam export.
- For larger-scale capacity plants, we offer our[SynCORTMhydrogen process](/products/equipment/syncortm-autothermal-reformer-atr)that is based on autothermal reforming, and which is especially suitable for very large capacities and high carbon capture requirements.

[Blue hydrogen](https://info.topsoe.com/blue-hydrogen-lp)is produced from hydrocarbon sources, such as natural gas, and combined with carbon capture technology. The captured carbon is then stored or utilized for industrial applications. Such carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU) drastically reduces CO2emissions and leads to a positive climate impact.

In hydrogen production processes, CO2is created both as a by-product of the reforming process (pre-combustion) and as a by-product of fuel firing (post-combustion).

For both pre-combustion and post-combustion CO2recovery technologies, we have well-established collaboration with reputed suppliers, and these units are integrated into the hydrogen plant design in the most optimal way to ensure a reliable and cost-effective operation of the plant.

## Green hydrogen produced by electrolysis

Green hydrogen is being produced by electrolysis, which is a process that uses electricity to split water molecules (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). When electrolysis is combined with renewable electricity, the production of fuels and chemicals can be decoupled from fossil resources, paving the way for an energy system based on 100% renewable energy.

Topsoe offers Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) technology which is attractive because of unrivaled conversion efficiencies – a result of favorable thermodynamics and kinetics at higher operating temperatures. Our high-temperature SOEC – solid oxide electrolyzer cell – delivers up to 30% more green hydrogen from the same amount of renewable electricity, compared to standard technologies like PEM and alkaline electrolysis.

Green hydrogen produced by SOEC can be processed further intoeMethanol, green ammonia, and a host of other green chemicals and fuels.

Some plants need to produce very small quantities of methanol. To meet this need, we have developed a solution for capacities from 1,000 MTPD down to as low as 100 MTPD.

Our small-scale offering is a fully modular plant which is a one-step process using our compact HTCR convection reformer instead of a traditional tubular reformer.

Topsoe’s small-scale methanol technologies offer a range of benefits, including:

- Capacities down to 100 MTPD
- Modularized design that shortens the time from decision to first production
- Modularized design for truck transportation enabling remote site operation
- Robustness process
- Meet on-demand requirements

## Small scale

## Applications within this area

Having a well-functioning purification of the feedstock for the hydrogen plant will have a great impact on the performance of downstream processes and their catalysts and it will contribute to a high on-stream factor of the facility.

Our different reforming technologies are tailor-made to meet the requirements of the customer without compromising on reliability.

Efficient carbon monoxide shift conversion plays an important role in the operating cost of the hydrogen plant.

If some cases producing CO2 as a byproduct of a hydrogen plant can improve the business case.

A well-functioning methanation section is vital for the optimal operation.

In order to meet the required hydrogen specification, purification technologies like PSA, membrane, cold box are required.

Decomposition of methanol is a proven and reliable way of obtaining high purity hydrogen or syngas with no requirement for high temperatures or pressures.

Electrified steam methane reforming of biogas for sustainable syngas  manufacturing and next-generation of plant design: A pilot plant study

Electrification of the traditional steam methane reforming (SMR) technology for syngas manufacturing has a  significant CO2 reduction potential and make it more feasible to operate in combination with carbon capture/  utilization, especially if renewable electricity is used. This pilot plant study demonstrates the first operational  experience with industrial-scale electrified steam methane reforming (eSMR) technology using biogas as sustainable carbon feedstock

Uncompromising protection

Syngas production poses many threats to catalyst activity and  longevity. The TK-240 deals with all these threats by efficiently  converting organic sulfur, chlorine and even olefins to substances  that are harmless to downstream catalysts.

Protect yopur catalysts against sulfur poisoning

Feed purification is a must in order to protect your downstream  catalysts from poisons in the hydrocarbon feedstock. With the  TK-250 hydrogenation catalyst from Topsoe, you can convert the  poisons efficiently while also protecting against pressure drops  caused by other impurities.

Superior syngas hydrogenation

The main pitfalls in syngas hydrogenation are insufficient conversion  plus poisoning and deactivation of downstream catalysts. Avoid these  pitfalls with the TK-261 from Topsoe.
