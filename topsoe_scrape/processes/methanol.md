### Methanol

High plant**availability**conversion, carbon and energy efficiency

#### High-efficiency methanol process technologies

Demand for methanol is driving producers to seek the greater yields and economies of scale that only larger plants can provide. As a result, 10,000 MTPD methanol plant layouts will likely soon be the new industry benchmark for large-scale production.Topsoe-designed methanol production plants combine advanced syngas generation and syngas-to-methanol processes with high-activity methanol production catalysts and comprehensive services. They are designed specifically to help you maximize yields and drive down costs.The methanol process descriptions below explain each of our methanol manufacturing processes. All of these processes are customized to meet the requirements of your individual methanol project.

## SynCOR Methanol™

Ideal for mega methanol plants, our SynCOR Methanol™ technology is the most cost-efficient methanol solution available anywhere.

SynCOR™ relies on our fully automated SynCOR™ syngas generator, which handles oxygen reforming at a uniquely low steam-to-carbon ratio.

Add in ultra-efficient methanol synthesis, and you get high availability, low environmental impact, and rock-bottom capital and operating expenses. In fact, SynCOR Methanol™ offers the lowest total cost of ownership of any comparable technology on the market.

SynCOR Methanol™ process technology accommodates single-train capacities as low as 500 MTPD and as high as 10,000 MTPD.

The main benefits of a SynCOR Methanol™ plant include:

- Cost-effective
- Enables giga capacities
- Superior economies of scale
- Energy-efficient
- Easy and reliable automated operation
- Guaranteed peace of mind
- Low CO2footprint
- Low methanol catalyst costs
- Low water consumption
- Low emissions
- Long runtime

Designed for medium- to large-capacity plants, and with an optimal range of 1000–5500 MTPD, Topsoe’s two-step plant combines our efficient, reliable side-fired tubular SMR design with oxygen-fired autothermal reforming.

Our two-step methanol designs are the most cost-effective designs of their kind and offer several proven benefits, including:

- Cost-effective
- Energy-efficient
- Easy and reliable operation
- Small CO2footprint
- Long runtime

## Two-step methanol plant

## One-step methanol plant

Our one-step methanol process is intended for small to medium size plant capacities and/or feedstocks with a high CO2content. This plant layout relies exclusively on our side-fired reforming design for generating hydrogen-rich syngas.

With an optimal capacity range of 500–2,500 MTPD, Topsoe’s one-step methanol plants provide the following benefits:

- Operational flexibility
- High plant availability
- Lower risk of unplanned shutdowns
- Long runtime
- Easy and reliable operation

Some plants need to produce very small quantities of methanol. To meet this need, we have developed a solution for capacities from 1,000 MTPD down to as low as 100 MTPD.

Our small-scale offering is a fully modular plant which is a one-step process using our compact HTCR convection reformer instead of a traditional tubular reformer.

Topsoe’s small-scale methanol technologies offer a range of benefits, including:

- Capacities down to 100 MTPD
- Modularized design that shortens the time from decision to first production
- Modularized design for truck transportation enabling remote site operation
- Robustness process
- Meet on-demand requirements

## Small scale

## Applications within this area

A well functioning purification of the feedstock to the methanol plant will have a great impact on the performance of downstream processes and their purification catalysts.

An efficient and reliable conversion of the feedstock has a huge impact on the economics of the plant. Our methanol reforming layouts are tailored for methanol reforming efficiency to meet the requirements of the client.

Methanol made better - SynCOR Methanol™

Topsoe provides cost-effective, energy-efficient methanol plant designs that give you exactly what you’re looking for. SynCOR Methanol™ is a combination of Topsoe SynCOR™ synthesis gas generation, methanol synthesis and distillation technologies and catalysts.

The role of the methanol-synthesis catalyst

The future of methanol production will be increasingly focused on green methanol and e-methanol, and this increased focus will necessitate modifications to existing methanol synthesis catalysts

TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE FUTURE WITH MK-417 SUSTAIN™

Converting greenhouse gas to sustainable methanol

Catalyzing methanol synthesis

Methanol production is increasing in locations where there is limited availability  or affordability of natural gas, but natural gas remains the predominate feed  and will most likely continue to do so for many years

Conventional Way of Assessing Methanol Synthesis Catalysts doesn't Reveal your Plant Potential

There are countless possible configurations and specifications to  consider when deciding on which methanol synthesis catalyst to  choose for your process.

Pre-reforming catalyst boots operational lifetime by more than 5 times

An Asian methanol producer had problems with their adiabatic prereformer. Frequent catalyst replacements were needed because a competitor's product could not live up to their lifetime guarantee

Topsoe helps methanol plant accelerate start-up and take advantage of low-cost natural gas

After a record-low construction and completion time, a  methanol plant was ready to start up. The time factor had been  very important all along, since cheap natural gas was readily  available, and each day the facility could not take advantage  of this situation meant lost revenue and profit. During startup, plant operators faced two main problems – one with the  natural gas compressor, the other involving the start-up nitrogen  compressor

Explore new possibilities

For methanol producers, there is an increasing focus on maximizing  plant profitability. The MK-181 PRIME™ is engineered to help you  explore new possibilities and realize the full potential of your  methanol plant.

Reduce costs every year for decades

Efficient conversion of CO and CO2 is a must for any methanation  catalyst. However, in order to minimize operating expenses, the  pressure drop must also be considered.

Safeguard your methanol production

Even trace amounts of impurities in the syngas pose a serious  threat to methanol plant efficiency and profitability. Iron is one of  the most severe poisons for methanol synthesis catalysts. In addition  to causing catalyst deactivation, iron also catalyzes the formation  of long chain hydrocarbons (wax). The MG-921 provides efficient and  proven protection of your methanol synthesis catalyst and helps you  achieve high plant efficiency and availability.

More value for money every day

In the field of methanol production, business success has always  depended on high plant availability, conversion and energy efficiency.  In today’s competitive market, catalysts that deliver these benefits  are more important than ever.

A proven formula for higher profits

In the methanol business, high conversion rates, plant availability  and energy efficiency are critical to sustained profitability. Our  MK-151 FENCE™ methanol synthesis catalyst delivers documented  industry-leading performance and stability, resulting in profit gains  over the catalyst’s lifetime that far outweigh your initial investment.

High and uniform density for maximum performance

The loading method you choose for your methanol synthesis catalyst will affect the performance of your reactor during the entire  lifecycle of the catalyst charge. Topsoe’s CassetteTM method is your  best choice for long-lasting efficiency and trouble-free operation.
