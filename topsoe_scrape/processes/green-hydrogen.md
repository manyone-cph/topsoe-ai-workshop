# YOUR GREEN HYDROGEN PARTNER

#### GREEN HYDROGEN PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THE ENERGY TRANSITION

Green hydrogen has the potential to decarbonize everything from long-distancetransportationto manufacturing– ultimately unlocking a future beyond fossil fuels for some of the world’s most energy-intensive industries.

A massive scale-up is underway. By 2030, an estimated 130 to 345 GW of electrolyzer capacity will be needed to meet demand, up from today’s installed base of just 1.1 GW*. Achieving this will be critical in enabling green hydrogen to constitute 14% of the total energy consumption by 2050 – a target essential to meeting global climate goals.

#### OVERCOMING THE CHALLENGES FOR GREEN HYDROGEN

Green hydrogen holds immense potential as a sustainable energy carrier. But scalingup its production still has significant challenges to overcome, especially when it comesto cost and infrastructure. A key part of the solution is to develop electrolyzertechnologies for improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness, in order to compete withconventional fuels. In parallel, the advancing technologies need to make their way fromthe lab to real, scalable applications.

At Topsoe, we come prepared for a green hydrogen future. With our high-performingelectrolysis technology, we offer a ready-for-market solution with a fast ROI. All whilewe are currently constructing our own electrolyzer stack manufacturing facility to further scale theproduction of green hydrogen.

#### HOW GREEN HYDROGEN WORKS IN POWER-TO-X

Green hydrogen in Power-to-X is the process of converting renewable electricity, into other forms of energy or products. This is driven by the production of hydrogen through electrolysis. The resulting hydrogen, known as green hydrogen, can either be used directly or serve as a base reactant to produce a variety of energy carriers and raw materials.
