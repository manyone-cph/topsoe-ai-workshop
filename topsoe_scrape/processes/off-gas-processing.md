### Off-Gas Processing

Minimize emissions from off gases

Off-gases formed at refineries often contain components such as diolefins, olefins, CO2, CO, hydrocarbons, H2S, and various organic sulfur species – all of which are harmful to the environment and subject to increasingly stricter regulations.At Topsoe, we provide a wide range of proven technologies that minimize emissions from off-gases and even convert the undesired components to high-value products. The result? More cost-effective compliance with environmental legislation.

## Applications within this area

H2S in refinery recycle and off-gasses is removed from the process by absorption in amine absorbers. Sour refinery off-gasses contain large amounts of H2S.

Topsoe offers a range of tail gas treatment catalysts that allow you to reach sulfur recoveries of 99.9% and comply with today's tight regulations.

Haldor Topsoe’s customized catalytic solution to clean up refinery fuel gas is the only offering of its kind and is commercially proven to improve refinery operations.

Topsoe's technology helps you to remove the sulfur compounds and ammonia impurities from your derived sour water before you reuse it in the refinery or discharge it.
