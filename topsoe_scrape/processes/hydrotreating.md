### Hydrotreating

Hydrotreating catalysts and technologies for all crude oil fractions

Refineries around the world are striving to meet growing demands for cleaner fuels, while ensuring cost-efficient operations. Getting the greatest value out of crude oil and effectively processing all the fractions – from very light gas and naphtha to residue – can be challenging. Topsoe offers hydrotreating catalysts and technologies for all crude oil fractions, enabling refineries to meet product specifications at a low cost and with higher profits. These solutions are built on over 40 years of experience and dedication to meeting customer needs through innovation.

## Applications within this area

Our hydrotreating solutions offer you the opportunity to meet all legislative requirements when producing clean fuels, either from conventional crude oil, or from alternative feeds.

Optimize all the all steps in your FCC gasoline post-treatment applications with Topsoe’s specifically developed series of HyOctane™ catalysts.

Topsoe’s high-performance catalysts and proprietary equipment enable you to generate the highest possible yield and value from your straight-run and cracked kerosene feeds.

High demands to get more value out of heavier feedstocks present new challenges for catalysts and technology. Topsoe offers related solutions for downstream petrochemicals processing.

Ensure long cycle lengths and maximum protection of downstream catalysts with Topsoe's hydrodemetallization (HDM) and hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts.

One of the keys to optimize the refinery margin is to have optimal fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit performance – both in terms of throughput, but also in terms of product slate.

Processing renewable feedstocks entails both more and more severe contaminants than processing fossil feedstocks. And since contamination is irreversible, it’s especially important to have the right catalysts.

Use co-processing in your kerosene hydrotreating for production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Our TK-930 catalyst maintains highest possible biogenic carbon in the jet fuel.

Produce renewable and fossil diesel through co-processing of renewable feedstock. The renewable feed can be introduced directly into your diesel hydrotreater with your fossil feed.
