**Looking to decarbonize?**

**Show, don’t tell.**

Aim high to secure low-carbon intensity blue ammonia. With up to 99%+ CO2 removal capabilities, our solutions lead the industry in decarbonization. We collaborate with carbon capture technology providers to ensureseamlessintegrationand industry-leading emission reduction– all in one single-point license.

**Achieving the best shade of blue**

The lower the carbon intensity, the more sustainable the solution. A vital part of blue ammonia production is the reformingtechnology used to produce syngas. And that is precisely where Topsoe is a cut above the rest.

We offer a wide portfolio of reforming technologies that produce ultra-low carbon intensity blue ammonia in single-line capacities of up to 6,000 MTPD.

**SynCOR Ammonia™ bridges sustainability with profitability****.**

At the heart of our reforming solutions is the market-leading SynCOR Ammonia™.

With a steam-to-carbon ratio of just 0.6, steam throughout the process is reduced by 80% while cutting water consumption drastically. Creating a previously unseen scaling factor for single-train ammonia plants.

This result can mean double-digit reductions in the cost per ton of producing ammonia – with significant savings achieved the further you scale.

**The benefits of SynCOR Ammonia™ Technology**

- Superior to traditional SMR
- Technology for large size plants
- Large capacities in single trains
- Great economy of scale
- Lowest OPEX.
- Minimal gas consumption
- Lowsteam-to-carbonratio
- Very low water consumption
- Reduced environmental impact
- High safety

**A CRACKING SOLUTION READY TO GO**

One of the biggest challenges in realizing a sustainable future is guaranteeing the availability of clean energy. And that need has turned hydrogen into an in-demand alternative fuel source. However, hydrogen is notoriously difficult to transport and store.

Enter blue ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. And enter our H2Retake™ ammoniacracking technology. H2Retake™ allows ammonia to be produced anywhere in the world, cracked in another, and consistently maintain the same high-quality hydrogen output.

Our ammonia cracking solution boasts a successful track record at the largest single-train production capacity available. And in a highly competitive industry, where even the slightest changes in performance can have a massive impact on the bottom line, being able to invest with confidence is invaluable. And H2Retake™ delivers just that.

**Introducing our best-in-class ammonia technologies**

**SynCOR Ammonia™**

By introducing new economies of scale into ammonia production, SynCOR Ammonia™ gives plant owners breakthrough options for profitable expansion and provides new investors with an opportunity to enter the market with a sharp competitive edge. SynCOR Ammonia™ leads the industry in efficiency, safety, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. And the lowest OPEX and highest carbon capture capabilities currently on the market.

**H2Retake™****ammonia**

With more than 30 years of experience, our ammonia cracking technologies and catalysts provide the means to extract hydrogen for use in fuel and chemical applications. The H2Retake™ cracking solution boasts market-leading conversion efficiency. Delivering significant commercial value and ensuring producers can supply low-carbon energy at volume. Introducing minimal risk for maximum profitability.

Blue Ammonia Fueling the Future Today

As the world transitions towards a sustainable  and carbon-neutral future, the need for clean  energy sources has become increasingly urgent.  Up until now, oil and fossil fuels are the dominant  feedstock for global scale energy export, import  and storage. However, the industrial transition,  driven by the global ambitions to limit greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions, and the continuous reduction  of renewable electricity costs, are changing the  landscape.

[Re]Route to better energy

Climate change is one of humanity’s biggest challenges, and the planet's demand for  low-carbon, high-purity energy products is at an all-time high. Hydrogen is often referred  to as ‘the fuel of the future' and is expected to play an important role in our strive towards  net zero.
