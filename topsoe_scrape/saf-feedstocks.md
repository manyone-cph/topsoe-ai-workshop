#### The feedstocks of the future have landed

As Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) takes flight, there is excitement about the directions it will take the aviation industry in and the possibilities it will bring — commercially and environmentally.

There are seven approved pathways to SAF and, at this moment, two of them are operating at commercial scale (HEFA-SPK & FT-SPK). Behind these pathways are proven technologies that we have been working with for some time.

But what about the feedstocks? The first (virgin oils) and second generation (waste oils and fats) of renewable feedstocks are quickly being spoken for or legislation goes against it. Simply put, there is not going to be enough to help the world fly sustainably.

The positive news is that the advanced, third generation of feedstocks are coming. These solid waste feedstocks can be derived from:- solid biomass waste,- rotational crops,- recycled carbon.

The process for processing solid waste feedstocks naturally differs somewhat from the first- and second-generation feedstocks. The principal divergence is the solid-to-liquid conversion process.

The technologies for this conversion process are almost ready and the knowledge is there but, due to the strict regulations in aviation, they are awaiting approval.

Solid waste feedstocks are a much more abundant resource and will remain so for many years to come. Advanced feedstocks are a thrilling development — and we will not be able to decarbonize aviation without them.

There’s no doubt about it, the demand for SAF is going to keep growing. And that is making it a tremendously exciting industry to be involved with.

With innovative technologies and cutting-edge knowledge enabling the upgrading of advanced feedstocks, fuel production is at the center of the global transition. And forward-thinking businesses will capture this by moving into new, advanced feedstocks while the opportunity is ripe.

Everything we do is based on the foundations we have built over decades. This means that when we are tackling advanced feedstocks, we are bringing in our knowledge of conversion of hydrocarbons while using and consuming the minimum amount of energy and securing the highest yields possible.

Whatever the type of advanced feedstock, we have a solution. Our[HydroFlex™](/our-resources/knowledge/our-products/process-licensing/hydroflextm-technology)solution began its first running reference in 2010 and has become the go-to technology for renewable fuels. Meanwhile, our[G2L™Biofuels](/our-resources/knowledge/our-products/process-licensing/g2ltm-technology)and[G2L™eFuels](/our-resources/knowledge/our-products/process-licensing/g2ltm-efuels-technology)solutions build on our commercially proven G2L™ offering to enable the production of several types of in-demand fuels.

We are just as excited as you about the potential for using advanced feedstocks in the production of SAF, and we can’t wait to work with you to implement them. Let’s fasten our seatbelts and take flight — to the future of feedstocks.

#### **Knowledge Special: SAF TALKSTM**

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) continues to be recognized as a crucial solution for driving down the CO2 emissions of the aviation industry. And yet, SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of the global jet fuel consumption.

To fuel knowledge sharing of what it'll take to scale-up SAF, we've composed a second season of SAF TalksTMfilmed during our second SAF Summit in Copenhagen in November 2023.

In a total of 9 bite-sized videos, frontrunners from across the SAF value chain share their latest trends and insights. And trust us! The industry is far from being at a standstill with numerous development underway...
