APPENDIX 4

- [Delegated act on the Production of Renewable Transport Fuels](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/7046068-Production-of-renewable-transport-fuels-share-of-renewable-electricity-requirements-_en): it provides a robust methodology for calculating the carbon intensity of the electricity used to produce RFNBOs. This electricity use is divided into three scenarios:

- Electrolyzers running directly on RES
- Those who have a Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA)
- Those that run on a grid with a RES penetration of at least 90%

The latest Commission proposal had stringent additionality requirements for renewable hydrogen producers.

- [Delegated Act on the method for assessing GHG emission savings for certain fuels](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12713-Renewable-energy-method-for-assessing-greenhouse-gas-emission-savings-for-certain-fuels_en): it prescribes how to assess emission reductions from recycled carbon fuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin. The latest proposal put forward by the Commission introduces a limit on the eligibility of industrial CO2[50](/sustainable-aviation-fuel/saf-study-references)for the production of synthetic fuels until 2035. After that date, only CO2captured from the air or from biogenic and geological sources can be used to produce synthetic fuels.
