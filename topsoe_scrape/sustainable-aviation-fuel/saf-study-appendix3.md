APPENDIX 3

Table shows volume share of sustainable aviation fuels and synthetic aviation fuels in the European Commission ReFuelEU proposal, the European Parliament amendments, and the Council of the European Union amendments.

*Source: The International Council on Clean Transportation:[Considerations for the ReFuelEU aviation trilogue (theicct.org)](https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/refueleu-definitions-trilogue-sep22.pdf)***

**Note**: Green cells denote where the ambition in the Parliament or Council amendments is the same as the commission proposal.

Note that this table does not reflect the European Parliament's vote in September 2022 on RED II, which actually recommends a 5.7% share in 2030 for renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) â€“ see Appendix 4 for further explanation.
