# ALL PATHSLEAD TO GREEN

07. PERSPECTIVE FROM JENS OLE MADSEN, EUROPEAN ENERGY

*“The transition from a fragmented sector to all the pieces coming together has been very fast. The technology is mature or maturing, the markets are there, governments are on board, and the public are pushing too.”*

Jens Ole Madsen, Head of Business Development (PtX), European Energy

#### Key Take-Aways

- Perceptions of SAF, once dominated by the EU and the USA, are**now global**
- **All paths lead to green hydrogen**and an eFuel future – perhaps in time for 2050
- To connect to the**grid**or use**island plants**is a big decision for producers
- Blue fuels will lead the way into the mid-2030s … with**green then taking their place**

Jens Ole’s global experience – he’s worked in Europe and the Middle East – confirms SAF isn’t a Western initiative, and that e-fuels from hydrogen and CO2are gaining traction at an incredible rate, albeit from a smaller base. Of course, Net Zero remains a dream today – but end-to-end solutions like that of European Energy are pushing forward with confidence.

European Energy is as green as it gets: solar farms, onshore and offshore wind, and PtX – the power-to-liquids process for fossil-free fuels. Its goals are unashamedly ambitious: Net Zero along the whole value chain, with renewable electricity producing green hydrogen for combining with biogenic CO2as e-methanol, one SAF feedstock.

**Jens Ole Madsen**’s role in business development focuses on PtX. He brings a global perspective to SAF thinking, seeing SAF not as an idea owned by the EU and coastal parts of the USA, but an awareness that’s now worldwide.

**THERE IS A CHANGE OF ATTITUDE EVERYWHERE**Even one year ago, there was a disconnect between industry understanding of SAF and its environmental potential. But today, many companies are not only ready for the transition – they’re driving the market. There’s a definite sense of “wow-factor” at every point in the value chain, all the right parts coming together – and since European Energy works end-to-end, we’re seeing this change of attitude everywhere.

What's more, this is a global phenomenon. Naturally, the EU and the USA are major players, but other countries like Brazil are deeply pro-SAF, as (perhaps surprisingly) are the oil-producing nations. So, the benefits of sustainable aviation fuel aren’t only a Western viewpoint; even wars don’t seem to be stopping the transition.

**BLUE TO START, THEN GREEN OVER TIME**In the PtX space (which relies on “green” hydrogen as one feedstock), two limiting factors are the availability of CO2and the availability of power. While this can be managed – European Energy’s Denmark project, the first to market of its kind, will produce 32,000t of eMethanol per year and is grid-connected – it’s an open question as to whether the renewable sources powering such operations will use the grid or dedicated “island” powerplants.

Jens Ole sees “blue” fuels as important in the next 10-15 years as part of the mix, but believes the 2030s will see bigger PtX projects operating in mature markets – with the blue blends starting to decline. He even sees an eventual phase-out of blue options a little earlier than most: probably by 2060.

**INCREASED COSTS ARE INEVITABLE**People aren’t yet pushing the “green button” to pay for offsets when they fly – meaning public perceptions and changing the passenger mindset may be a challenge. But the attraction of 100% carbon-neutral fuels may overcome this, with the 1% of people responsible for most APKs realizing increased costs are inevitable. Further out is the dream: a truly Net Zero world by 2060 – with aviation playing its part.

**THE NEED FOR SAF IS NOW ENTRENCHED**SAF isn’t a discrete sector, nor is blue or green SAF an answer on its own. Feedstocks are in demand across road and marine sectors as well as aviation; energy requirements for green fuels are creating challenges for grid capacity. But the need for SAF is now entrenched worldwide – which is great news for our planet. Let’s move on.
