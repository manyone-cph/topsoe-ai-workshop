**Co-processing of renewable feedstocks**

Climate change is one of humanity’s biggest challenges. We need to take urgent action to reduce the detrimental effects of how we produce and consume. This shift is already supported by regulations, mandates, and policies worldwide, demanding an increase in the production of renewable fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

**Empowering you for action today!**

Proven technologies to produce these renewable fuels at scale already exist. But for refineries, making the transition to a biorefinery requires significant financial investment and time.

Co-processing provides a simple alternative to these major revamps. It provides an accessible pathway for a conventional refinery to transition into a renewable refinery.

At Topsoe, we have been supporting our customers in their co-processing ambitions since our initial project with Preem in 2011. Since then, we have expanded our support to over 50 different projects.

**Co-processingunveiled**

In co-processing, even small amounts of fossil feedstock, e.g. crude oil, can be replaced with renewable feedstock (HEFA-based), e.g. vegetable oil, animal fat, used-cooking oil etc. These are processed together to produce renewable fuel.

**Pick your co-processing pathway**

At Topsoe, we offer three different co-processing solutions, helping you to introduce renewable feedstock into your existing kerosene hydrotreater, diesel hydrotreater, or in your hydrocracker.

Our extensive commercial experience and R&D developments within refinery technologies have made us pioneers in renewables hydroprocessing, ready to provide services, technologies, and catalysts that will help you overcome the difficulties often associated with renewable feedstock.

**Co-processing for diesel hydrotreating**

Produce renewable and fossil diesel trough co-processing of renewable feedstock. The renewable feed can be introduced directly into your diesel hydrotreater with your fossil feed.

**Co-processing in kerosene**

Use co-processing in your kerosene hydrotreating for production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Our TK-930 catalyst maintains highest possible biogeneric carbon in the jet fuel.

TotalEnergies has selected Topsoe’s isomerization catalysts for co-processing SAF at its Gonfreville refinery in France. It is the first SAF co-processing project Topsoe is involved in. Based on used cooking oil, it is planned to produce 40,000 tons SAF from 2025. With European SAF mandates of 2% in 2025 increasing to 6% in 2030, refiners in Europe are exploring different routes for SAF production. With a proper selection of technology and catalysts, co-processing is an attractive solution to reach the mandated volumes.
