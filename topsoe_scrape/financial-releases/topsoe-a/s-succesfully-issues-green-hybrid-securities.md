“Topsoe is determined to demonstrate leadership in technologies and solutions for carbon emission reductions. For the energy transition to happen at the needed pace and scale, partnerships must be formed, and significant investments must be made. We are very pleased with the strong support from our investors as this will allow us to accelerate our essential contribution to the formation of strong markets for e-fuels, low-carbon fuels and renewable fuels”, says Allan Bødskov Andersen, Chief Financial Officer at Topsoe.

The green hybrid securities are intended to be listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S’ regulated market (under the Sustainable Debt segment) no later than 9 months after issuance.
