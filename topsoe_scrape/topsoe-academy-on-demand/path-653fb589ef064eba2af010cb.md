## Description:

This learning path in basic catalyst theory and operation covers the catalysts that you typically have in an ATR-based GTL plant.You will gain an in-depth look into the characteristics of the catalysts as well as the reactions that occur. Based on this, you will learn about the general optimal operating conditions of the catalysts, as well as the typical operational challenges which plants face for the different catalysts. Some process aspects are also covered, but the main focus will be on the catalysts.

## Content:

This learning path awards a certificate once completed and consists of 4 courses, each of which will focus on a different reactor/catalyst type:

- Feed purification - Hydrogenation catalyst
- Feed purification - Desulfurization absorbents
- Prereforming catalyst
- Autothermal reformer catalyst

Each course consists of 5-8 lessons and a summary exam. Expected time to complete is approximately 45 minutes per course.
