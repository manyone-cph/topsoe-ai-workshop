## Description:

This learning path gives you the insight you need to ensure that your next loading will be a success and covers the loading types that are relevant for SMR-based hydrogen plants. This includes both adiabatic reactor loadings as well as tubular reformer loadings.Effective catalyst loading is the first step to optimized performance and achieve maximum lifetimes. With an emphasis on both planning and execution, this learning path will help you achieve smooth collaboration with the TOPSOE™ Engineer to ensure safe and efficient loadings with minimal delays and with maximum performance, once your plant is operational.

## Content:

This learning path awards a certificate once completed and consists of 4 courses, each of which will focus on a specific aspect of loadings or a certain type of loading:

- Loading safety
- General loading considerations
- Adiabatic reactor loadings
- Tubular reformer loadings - SpiraLoad™

Each course consists of 5-8 lessons and a summary exam. Expected time to complete is approximately 45 minutes per course.
