## Description:

It normally takes years to acquire a solid feel for how to operate a plant. This learning path will give you a head start in operating a SMR-based hydrogen plant, making you an “early expert” and helping you get more value out of future practical experience. This learning path is the last part of the “Operator training” learning path.Our flexible, tailored General Plant Operation learning path will give you a basic understanding of plant operation, including how to identify and solve some of the common challenges you can face during operation.

## Content:

This learning path awards a certificate once completed and consists of 8 courses, each of which will focus on different sections of the plant, focusing on the critical parameters and controls associated with each individual section, as well as the cause, consequence and corrective action for specific scenarios that you can expect to face during normal operation:

- Feed purification section operation
- Prereformer and mix point operation
- Tubular reformer section operation
- Combustion section operation
- Steam system operation
- CO conversion section operation
- Cooling train and product purification operation
- Process condensate treatment operation

Each course consists of 5-8 lessons and a summary exam. Expected time to complete is approximately 45 minutes per course.
