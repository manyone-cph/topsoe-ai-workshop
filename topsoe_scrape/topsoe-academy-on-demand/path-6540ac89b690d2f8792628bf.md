## Description:

By improving your understanding of basic plant design and process-catalyst interaction in a SMR-based hydrogen plant, this learning path will make sure you’re prepared to make the most of subsequent on-the-job training. This learning path is part two of the “Operator training” learning path.Balancing theory and real-life cases, our flexible, tailored General Plant Understanding course gives you a basic insight into how your plant is designed and how your catalysts and processes work together. This will enable you to learn more – and more quickly – as you go about your work and take part in on-the-job training.

## Content:

This learning path awards a certificate once completed and consists of 5 courses, each of which will focus on different sections of the plant, focusing on the overall process that takes place in the sections and the controls associated with the various equipment:

- Feed preparation & purification section understanding
- Reforming section understanding
- Combustion and flue gas section understanding
- BFW and steam system understanding
- CO conversion, PSA and LTM system understanding

Each course consists of 5-10 lessons and a summary exam. Expected time to complete is approximately 45 minutes per course.
